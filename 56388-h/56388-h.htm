<span class="smcap">House of Representatives<br />
Subcommittee of the<br />
Committee on Un-American Activities</span>,<br />
<i>Washington, D. C.</i><br />
</h4>

<h5>PUBLIC HEARING</h5>

<p>A subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 10 a. m. in the caucus
room, Old House Office Building, Hon. Morgan M. Moulder (chairman)
presiding.</p>

<p>Committee members present: Representatives Morgan M. Moulder,
Clyde Doyle, and Harold H. Velde.</p>

<p>Staff members present: Frank S. Tavenner, counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. The subcommittee will be in order, please.</p>

<p>Let the record show that the Honorable Francis E. Walter, chairman,
Committee on Un-American Activities, pursuant to the provisions
of law creating this committee, appointed Representatives Clyde
Doyle, of California, Harold H. Velde, of Illinois, and myself, Morgan
M. Moulder, of Missouri, as chairman of a subcommittee to conduct
this hearing. All the members of the subcommittee are present.</p>

<p>The hearing today is a continuation of the hearings initiated in
Seattle on June 14, 1954, and resumed in Seattle on March 17, 1955.</p>

<p>The purpose of the hearings in Seattle was to discover the activities
of the Communist Party in the Pacific Northwest area, the extent of
Communist infiltration in that area, and the methods resorted to by
the Communist Party in the accomplishment of its objectives in
that area.</p>

<p>Two outstanding witnesses were heard: Mrs. Barbara Hartle, during
the hearings of June 14, 1954, and Mr. Eugene V. Dennett during
the hearings of March 17, 1955. It is the hope of the committee that
the witness to be heard today will throw additional light on the
subject of this inquiry.</p>

<p>Today’s witness was subpenaed to appear before the committee at
the March 1955 hearings in Seattle, but due to illness was not heard
at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. Tavenner, are you ready to proceed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Jeremiah Joseph O’Connell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moulder</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony which
you are about to give before this subcommittee will be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I do.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="TESTIMONY_OF_JEREMIAH_JOSEPH_O_CONNEL">TESTIMONY OF JEREMIAH JOSEPH O’CONNELL</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What is your name, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Jeremiah Joseph O’Connell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you also known by the name of Jeremiah J.
O’Connell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I would presume that my baptismal name in
the Catholic Church was probably Jeremiah J. O’Connell, but during
grade school, high school, college, and law school, and in my political
career I have always been known as Jerry J. O’Connell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, you are acquainted with the practice
of the committee to permit witnesses to be accompanied by counsel and
to confer with counsel if a witness desires?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I understand that, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It is noted that you are not accompanied by counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I had expected Senator Langer of North Dakota
to appear with me, but his office notified me today he was out of town
and wasn’t going to be able to get back until this afternoon, but I have
worried about this thing, and I have been under tension about it, and I
am anxious to get it over with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You are satisfied, then, to proceed without having
counsel with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Of course, should it develop at any point in your
testimony you desire to consult counsel, you may address your request
to the committee.</p>

<p>When and where were you born, Mr. O’Connell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was born in Butte, Mont., on October 4, 1908.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where do you now reside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I now reside at Great Falls, Mont.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, briefly what
your educational training has been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I received my grammar school education at
St. Patrick’s School in Butte, Mont., my high school education at
Butte Central Catholic High School in Butte, Mont., my liberal arts
education at Mount St. Charles College, now known as Carroll College,
where I graduated with an A. B. degree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In what year did you graduate from that college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. 1931.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where did you receive your A. B. degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Mount St. Charles College, now known as Carroll
College, in Helena, Mont., in 1931.</p>

<p>Through the late Senator Thomas J. Walsh, of Montana, I obtained
employment here in the District with the Democratic National Committee,
later in 1931, and attended law school at Columbus Law School
here in the District.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you receive a degree?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I did not. I was elected to the Legislature of
the State of Montana in 1931, when I was only 21 years of age and
while a senior at Mount St. Charles College. I came back here and
went to law school and then in 1932 during the summer vacation I
went back and sought renomination and reelection to the State legislature
and was successful.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span></p>

<p>I served in the 1933 session of the State legislature. Also in a
special session of the legislature in the latter part of 1933 and the
early part of 1934.</p>

<p>In between I came back and continued taking law courses in between
the legislative sessions and so on, and later studied law privately at
home and in a law office at Butte, Mont., and then in 1934 I was elected
to the State Railroad and Public Service Commission of Montana,
which is a statewide elective office in the State, and then in 1936 I
was elected to the 75th Congress of the United States from the First
Western District of the State of Montana.</p>

<p>I served one term, from 1937 to 1939, and was defeated in the 1938
general elections. I won the Democratic nomination.</p>

<p>In 1940 I again won the Democratic nomination and was defeated
in the 1940 election by Jeannette Rankin.</p>

<p>After my defeat I edited a statewide weekly newspaper called Jerry
O’Connell’s Montana Liberal. I also was active politically and particularly
in the organization of an old-age pension group in which
I had the principal activity or principal organizational activity in the
State.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Is that in the State of Montana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the date of the organization of the old-age
pension group by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I actually think that I&mdash;it is quite a long
while ago now&mdash;it was 1939, if I remember correctly. I began holding
meetings in various parts of the State and we were advancing a
State, it was a State initiative for improvement of the pension situation
as far as senior citizens were concerned in the State. I think
that came out in 1938 campaign, I had originally been endorsed by
the Townsend organization for reelection to Congress and then during
the 1938 general elections Dr. Townsend flew from Hawaii into my
district and made 3 speeches against me, 2 or 3 speeches. I am not
sure which. And the result was a considerable division in the Townsend
organization as it existed in the State then, and out of that I am
pretty sure at that time there was a gentleman by the name of Arthur
L. Johnson, who was promoting I think what he called the general
welfare acts or general welfare plan, and on a State pattern, using
that general welfare act we promoted a pension plan in the State of
Montana on an initiative, we have an initiative law there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. May I ask a question, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>You mentioned you studied law here at Columbus Law School and
in a law office, I believe, in Butte, Mont.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you pass the bar of the State of Montana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I passed the bar of the State of Montana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I do not think you mentioned that. When did that
happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I actually didn’t pass the bar in Montana. I had
been active politically and I didn’t pass the State bar examination
until June 23, 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Since that time you have been a practicing lawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Since then I have been practicing law at Great
Falls, Mont.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you been admitted to practice in any State
other than Montana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you held any other organizational positions
of any character in the State of Montana or elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, in I think about February 1944 I was appointed
by Sidney Hillman as CIO political action director for the
State of Montana, and in about August of 1944&mdash;in that year I was
elected delegate to the Democratic National Convention from the State
of Montana and attended the Chicago convention in that year.</p>

<p>In August of 1944 after the convention I was appointed assistant
regional director for the CIO Political Action Committee with offices
or headquarters at Seattle, Wash., under the director who was Roy
W. Atkinson, and that region included Washington, Idaho, Oregon,
and Montana.</p>

<p>After I went to the State of Washington, I became active particularly
with&mdash;one of the principal activities of the CIO political action
committee was to advance and encourage registration for voting in
the 1944 elections and in the State of Washington, particularly along
the West coast there was a considerable influx of war workers during
that period who, of course, were unregistered and my principal activity
preceding the actual beginning of that 1944 general campaign was
bringing about registration by getting the city councils in the various
larger cities, particularly in the State of Washington, to hold a
registration week and opening up the schools and then after the
campaign, as I was explaining, the city councils called a registration
week where there was the extended registration campaign or program
carried on, and after that I then became assistant regional
director for the CIO political action committee active with the Democratic
organization, particularly in the State of Washington and of
course also to some extent in Idaho and I don’t think during that
campaign at all that I appeared in the State of Oregon.</p>

<p>I was back in Montana a few times in that connection but I spent
the principal part of that time working with the Democratic Party
organization in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you hold any position in the Democratic organization
in the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. At that time I didn’t hold any. After the election&mdash;the
Democratic Party was considerably successful in the State
of Washington&mdash;and I think the Democratic Party leaders had a
feeling that I had made a considerable contribution to the success
which they had.</p>

<p>Within a few weeks after the election the Democratic Party leaders
in that State discussed with me taking a full-time position with the
Democratic Party in the State of Washington as executive secretary
of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That began in 1944?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was elected by the State central committee at
Ellensburg, Wash., I think somewhere about in the middle of December
1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long did you continue in that position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I continued in that position then until December,
actually I ended my term as executive secretary some time in the beginning
of the year, January 1947.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span></p>

<p>In December 1946 a new Democratic State chairman was elected
and he abolished the position of executive secretary and took the job
and worked on the job on a full-time basis himself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After that time did you hold an executive position
with the Progressive Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, let me, in order to keep it in chronological
order, I would like to say that after that election there was of course
a considerable division in the Democratic Party over the results of
the election which were quite disastrous for the Democratic Party in
1946, and there was a considerable cleavage among what was considered
to be the conservative forces in the party and the liberal forces
in the party and at the convention at Ellensburg in December of 1946
the conservative element or conservative forces in the Democratic
Party were in control by a very slight margin.</p>

<p>The liberal forces in the Democratic Party then organized within
the Democratic Party a group known as Roosevelt Democrats, and
I was I think also called the executive secretary, or given the title,
elected as executive secretary of the Roosevelt Democrats and I served
in that position until April of 1948 when I resigned from the Democratic
Party and actually began to work for the organization of the
Progressive Party in the State of Washington. We had set up what
we called a provisional committee for a new party. I had supported
Henry Wallace for Vice President in the 1944 Democratic convention.
I was a considerable admirer of his, and I joined with the people
who were forming the Progressive Party, and I think then&mdash;I would
say in probably May or June of 1948&mdash;the Progressive Party of the
State of Washington was organized at a State convention in Seattle,
Wash., and I was elected executive secretary of the Progressive Party
at that convention, and I served in that capacity until October 1949,
when I left the State of Washington and went back to the State of
Montana and began studying law and preparing for the taking of the
bar examinations which I eventually took.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After your return to the State of Montana in 1949
did you hold any other organizational positions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I did not. On many occasions&mdash;in October of
1949 I had made up my mind that I had given the best years of my
life to political activity. In July of 1949 Mrs. O’Connell and I had a
young son after having been married about 13 years. Mrs. O’Connell
had a very, very difficult time in giving birth to our son, and for 5
days her life was in danger. Her folks live at Great Falls, Mont.
She is a native of Great Falls. She wanted to go back there to be with
her folks. Up to that time I had always studied law with the idea of
being an attorney and I wanted to be one and so we went back to the
State of Montana and I have not been engaged in any partisan political
organization or affairs of any kind since my return to the State of
Montana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The committee has information that after that time
you became chairman of the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt
Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. In 1948, I would say probably in June of
1948, while I was executive secretary of the Progressive Party of the
State of Washington, I came down to the city of Washington here to
testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was then considering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
the Mundt bill, which had already passed the House. We
were to testify at a hearing before which I think Senator Ferguson
was presiding and Senator Langer was sitting with him and apparently
the hearings had gone on for several days and Senator Ferguson
adjourned the hearings or at least announced there would be no further
hearings at that time before many of us there had yet been heard.</p>

<p>Senator Langer then suggested that we go to his office, I think at that
time he was chairman of the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads
in the Senate, and we retired to his committee room. At that time we
discussed particularly with him the situation as far as the Mundt bill
was concerned and at his suggestion this committee to oppose the
Mundt Bill was set up and at that particular meeting I was elected
chairman of the group. Senator Langer, of course, had known me
while I was in Congress and suggested&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the approximate date when you were
selected as chairman of the committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My best recollection, my best guess would be some
time in June of ’48.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You continued to serve as chairman of the National
Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill for how long a period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, in 1948, if I remember correctly, the bill was
not voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee before the adjournment
of Congress at that particular time. The bills as I remember
were proposed again at the beginning of the next session of Congress
and we continued to oppose the legislation at that time and then
finally I think&mdash;if I remember correctly, in about, I would say, about
March of 1950&mdash;I came down here again to the city of Washington. If
I remember correctly, the bill had again passed the House of Representatives
at that time although I am not too sure. I think it had.</p>

<p>I stayed here from I would say March&mdash;I remember I defended
somebody at home in court at Great Falls and I came down here I
would say in the latter part of March 1950 and I stayed until about
the 9th or 10th day of June 1950 when I returned to Montana to bone
up for the bar examination which I was taking on the 23d of June 1950.</p>

<p>I passed the bar examination at that time and I came back here
again. My offhand guess would be that I came back again some time
maybe in the latter part of July or first part of August of 1950 and
stayed here until Congress adjourned sine die, I think somewhere
around September, probably September 13.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During that period of time were you actively engaged
in the work of the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt
Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do I understand, Mr. O’Connell, that you continued in
the 82d Congress the same type of work you were doing as far as the
Mundt bill was concerned in the 81st Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If those are the correct&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You were chairman of the committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was chairman of the committee from the time
I was selected in June of 1948 until the committee dissolved after the
passage of the legislation over the President’s veto in September of
1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Of course, that would be the committee, I suppose, which
was set up to defeat the McCarran-Wood bill.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The Mundt-Nixon bill was combined, I think it
was combined by a proposal made by several of the Senators over
there and also the McCarran Act, I can’t remember all the things that
went on in connection with it now, but I think it became popularly
called the McCarran Act, if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The McCarran-Wood bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. I think the language became the Internal
Security Act.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Who composed the committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Actually the executive officers were myself as chairman,
Robert Silverstein of the National Lawyers Guild as secretary,
and Bruce Waybur, who was an official or an organizational employee
of the United Electrical Workers<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> who was treasurer of the organization,
and then the group was sponsored by various outstanding prominent
individuals throughout the country. I can’t remember all of
them now and all who from time to time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. If I remember correctly, after the bill was passed and
became law there was a committee to repeal the McCarran-Wood Act,
was there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think there was, but I had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You had no part in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I had no part in it. I went back. I think Professor
Chafee [Zechariah Chafee, Jr.] at Harvard and some others organized
a committee to repeal the act after that, but I went back to
Montana and I had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, whether or not
you became regional director for the International Workers Order
during the period of time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. I think that language that you use comes
from an old report of the Dies committee. I was never regional
director for the IWO. The only connection that I had with the IWO
is that in the city of Butte the IWO had an affiliated local or lodge
there composed of Serbs and Croats and there was considerable division
particularly during the war period, World War II period, because
if I remember correctly there was a religious difference. I think
the Serbs in the organization were Protestants and the Croats were
Catholics. There was a division then over the politics of the situation.
I think there were some of them who were supporting Milhailovich
at that time and some who were supporting Pavlich, if I remember
the names correctly.</p>

<p>I was asked by&mdash;I am pretty sure the man’s name was Peter Shipka,
who was the officer of the International Workers Order, who asked me
if I would advise with the lodge and if I would help them try to
straighten out the difficulties so that the lodge could go ahead.</p>

<p>After that I was sent down to the State of Colorado or asked by
them to go down to the State of Colorado where I think about 11
members of the IWO had applied for their citizenship papers in a
little town I think called Steamboat Springs, Colo., and the Federal
judge who was hearing the citizenship matter at that time was in my
opinion confusing the IWO with the IWW, and I was asked and
again I wouldn’t be sure who the national officer of the IWO was, but
my best recollection at the time&mdash;and I think that was in 1940 or 1941
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>
or 1942, it was a long time ago&mdash;asked me to go down there and I
talked with the judge and with the examiner and also brought a Mr.
Cunningham who I think was either the State auditor or the secretary
of state, but was ex officio commissioner of insurance of the State of
Colorado, to show the judge the IWO was actually a fraternal benefit
society and had no connection with the IWW.</p>

<p>Then later, I can’t remember what year, the IWO was promoting
what they called a Plan for Plenty, which was in essence an improvement
on the present social security, or I mean on the social security
system as it existed at that time.</p>

<p>I made speeches at various IWO lodges in different parts of the
country speaking on the Plan for Plenty, explaining the legislative
detail in connection with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who made arrangements with you to conduct this
nationwide speaking tour that you mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, it is so long ago, it is hard for me&mdash;there
are just two names that stick out in my memory as far as the IWO
is concerned and the only two I can remember are Peter Shipka,
the treasurer, and if I remember correctly they had an attorney
named Joseph Brodsky. Those are the two names that stick out in
my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was Joseph Brodsky from New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; he was from New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What compensation did you receive while engaged
in that work for the IWO?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, at the time it was very minimal, I can
remember that. I would say that as far as&mdash;it would amount, in
my opinion, for the small period of time I was involved, which I
would say was a period of a few months, I would say on the average
of about $200 a month. It was not very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And your expenses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. And my expenses; yes. As I remember, they
were quite restrictive on the expenses; if I remember correctly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do I understand that your connection with the
IWO was one of employment rather than one of an official character?
Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is correct. I think that would be the best
way to describe it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. For how long a period were you employed by the
IWO?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My best recollection is that that employment was
over a period of maybe 5 or 6 months. It might have been 7 or 8.
It was not very long, and I don’t think I could put it in the precise
year or years that were involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it resumed at a later date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; it was not resumed at any later date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you receive any compensation or money from
the IWO for anything other than the services you have mentioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I certainly don’t recollect any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, whether you
had any employment since 1930 other than the positions you have
already described and other than those matters related to the practice
of law?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, going back in 1930, I was still a student in
St. Charles College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We can pass that up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. At Helena. Of course, during the summer
months I was employed in the Anaconda Copper Mining Co.’s mines
at Butte while I went to school. I think the summer of 1932 I was
employed by the Industrial Accident Board of the State of Montana
settling compensation cases during that period. I think I told about
my employment with the Democratic National Committee while I
was back here.</p>

<p>I also had some employment as legal adviser to the State income-tax
division of the State board of equalization of the State of Montana
while I was running for State railroad and public service commissioner
in Montana and before my election to that post. Then I think
I have detailed all of the rest of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, you spoke of being instrumental in
organizing an old-age pension initiative, I believe you call it, in the
State of Montana in 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I remember, we were trying to put it on the
1940 ballot in Montana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You are familiar, I suppose, with the Washington
State Pension Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I am. I would like to say that at the time
I was organizing the clubs in Montana I knew nothing whatever of
the existence of the Washington Pension Union of the State of Washington,
or any of its officers, or anybody connected with it. My first
connection with the organization and the group was when I went to
the State of Washington in 1944. Those contacts were made in my
position as executive secretary of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were also familiar, of course, with the Washington
Commonwealth Federation, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really couldn’t say that I was, Mr. Tavenner.
I think the Washington Commonwealth Federation was still in existence
when I went to the State of Washington in 1944, but if I remember
correctly, shortly after the elections in November of 1944 the
Washington Commonwealth Federation was dissolved but I had
no connection with the Washington Commonwealth Federation at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you become acquainted with Barbara Hartle
after you became a resident of the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I naturally read some of the news stories in
both the Seattle Post Intelligencier and the Seattle Times. And I
heard about her. Now, I don’t recall her too well but I am pretty
sure that in the early days of the WPA in the State of Montana she,
I think she was working in the Great Falls area; if I remember her
correctly, she is rather short and squat, rather pasty complexion? I
don’t remember her too well. I can remember she&mdash;I think I saw
her once or twice at that time while I was on the Public Service Commission
and later when I was in Congress, a group of people had gone
down and raided a commodity warehouse in Great Falls and had taken
food and various things out of the commodity warehouse. If I
remember her correctly, at that time she was on a committee that
came to see me to use my influence to see that they weren’t prosecuted
for what they had done.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span></p>

<p>Then I later saw her in the State of Washington, my feeling would
be maybe 3 or 4 times. I am pretty sure; I don’t remember her too
well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Could you place those times you did see her more definitely
as to the year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really couldn’t. I was in the State of Washington
from August of 1944 until October of 1949, and it is over that
period of time that I actually saw her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During the 1954 hearings of this committee in
Seattle, Barbara Hartle was asked to tell the committee from her
own personal knowledge what connection the Washington Pension
Union had, if any, with Communist activity in that area. I should
state to you that Barbara Hartle was one of the Smith Act defendants
in the State of Washington and was convicted. She testified before
this committee after her conviction and sentence. She testified very
fully regarding her knowledge of Communist Party activities in the
Northwest. She described the circumstances under which she became
a member of the Communist Party and how she rose to the No. 2 position
in the Communist Party in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>This is the answer that she gave to the question of the connection
between the Washington Pension Union and Communist activities:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was quite a lot of connection with Communist activity in this area
between the Communist Party and the Washington Pension Union. The Northwest
district of the Communist Party has paid a great deal of attention to the
Washington Pension Union for a long period of years. What to do next in the
pension union has been the subject of many discussions in district board and
district committee meetings in which I have participated between the period of
1932 to 1940 and in large district committee meetings before that in the latter
1930’s.</p>

<p>Important offices and many local offices of the Washington Pension Union
have been held by Communist Party members, and the activities and policies of
the pension union have always been supported by the Communist Party. Many
issues have been brought into the pension union by the Communist Party and
gained wide support by so doing. The Communist Party in this district viewed
the Washington Pension Union as really its most important single front organization.
It is called mass organization by the Communist Party. They don’t
use the term “front organization.” They call it a mass organization. It was
the largest and most influential and second only to the Washington Commonwealth
Federation, which was a federation of organizations, and the Washington
Pension Union was an affiliate of the Washington Commonwealth Federation,
in which the Communist Party likewise had a dominating influence.</p></blockquote>

<p>I think I should read a little further. Mrs. Hartle also testified
that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. May I say I had no connection; I was not an officer
of the Washington Pension Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I was going to discuss that question, whether or
not you were affiliated in any way with the Washington Pension
Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think as executive secretary of the Democratic
Party and as executive secretary of the Progressive Party I made
speeches to State conventions of the Washington Pension Union, as
did practically all the political leaders of the State of Washington,
regardless of the party.</p>

<p>I think during a period after my employment as executive secretary
of the Democratic Party at the request of a local in Everett I was sent
there to make a speech and I think I was&mdash;I am pretty sure I was paid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
expenses and I may have been paid a fee for the speech I made to the
group at Everett at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was that a convention of the Washington Pension
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, as I remember it, the Everett meeting was some
kind of a large local meeting that they had, some kind of an event or
celebration or something of that kind that I spoke at. It is hard to
recollect. It is a long time ago and I have made a lot of speeches all
over the State of Washington in those years and to a lot of groups.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you work closely with the leadership of the
union in the political positions that you held, first, as secretary of the
State Democratic Party and later as secretary of the Progressive
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know if you would say I worked closely.
We were naturally anxious in both the Democratic Party and in the
Progressive Party to get the votes of the senior citizens of the State
of Washington, and the only pension organization, the only senior
citizens organization at that particular time anyway I can remember
was the Washington Pension Union.</p>

<p>I think later there were some dissensions and shoot-offs and smaller
groups organized but I mean I had no official connection with the pension
union. Pennock, who was the president of the Pension Union,
was also Democratic representative from the 35th Legislative District.
He was the chairman of what we called the delegates from that district
to the King County Democratic Central Committee. He was, I think,
a chairman or member of the rules committee on the Democratic side
in the State legislature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is William Pennock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is William Pennock. In his activity as a
Democrat or member of the Democratic organization as executive secretary
of the Democratic Party, I naturally saw Pennock and naturally
he was involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he one of the Smith Act defendants in the State
of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I am informed, he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And was convicted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t think so. He died.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I understand it, he either committed suicide or
was found dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During the period of the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. While the trial was in progress, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you know William Pennock to be a member of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I did not. As I understand, he never divulged
his membership in the Communist Party until a few days before
the Smith Act trial and I think he made a public statement at that
time.</p>

<p>I, by that time, was back in the State of Montana some 4 or 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I would like to continue to present the testimony of
Mrs. Hartle regarding the Washington Pension Union to make plain
a few facts. Mrs. Hartle further testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>My knowledge of the membership of the pension union is that it was reported
by William J. Pennock and others in meetings that it had about 10,000 members.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span></p>

<p>She further testified:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The membership of the Communist Party in the organization was small,
smaller than in most so-called mass organization work. This was considered
by the district leadership of the Communist Party and by the national leadership
as well as being evidence of very successful mass work, and it was often
used as an example of successful Communist mass work where it didn’t take
so many Communists in order to influence a large number of people.</p></blockquote>

<p>Were you aware of the influence that was brought to bear by the
Communist Party upon this organization, the Washington Pension
Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, sir; I certainly wasn’t aware of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you know of any issues that were brought to the
Washington Pension Union by the Communist Party as testified to
by Mrs. Hartle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, sir; I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have told us that you spoke on numerous occasions
at meetings of the pension union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wouldn’t want to make it numerous. I spoke
several times. I spoke at their State conventions, I know that, during
the period while I was executive secretary of the Democratic Party
and while I was executive secretary of the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you familiar with the testimony of Ernest Paul
Stith before the Canwell committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If I remember, he was an investigator for the Canwell
committee. I don’t know what his testimony was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Stith analyzed a report contained in the January
30, 1947, issue of the New World relating to a program that was
conducted at the Tri-County Snohomish, Whatcom, and Skagit Legislative
Conference. The analysis goes on to show that 21 of the 99
delegates at that convention represented the pension union. The
speakers included William Pennock, president of the Washington Old
Age Pension Union, and Jerry O’Connell, former Democratic Party
State executive secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think that is the meeting I was talking about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is the one you were referring to. Terry Pettus
was editor of the New World. Was that a Communist paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know whether the New World was a Communist
paper. There apparently was some distinction; they later became
the Northwest edition of the People’s World, and, of course,
the People’s World, as I understand it, is a Communist newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And Frank Batterson, chairman of the Snohomish
County Communist Party was a speaker. You say that is the occasion
to which you refer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am pretty sure that is the occasion&mdash;was that
held at Everett; does it say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It doesn’t state where it was held.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t even know Batterson. He certainly didn’t
speak while I was there and of course I had no knowledge of the fact
that he was a speaker and no knowledge of the fact that he was chairman
of&mdash;what group of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall William Pennock speaking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t recall him speaking, no, but I am sure that
if it were&mdash;you see, I may have spoken. Does it say how many days
it lasted?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t remember Pennock speaking while I was
there&mdash;at least that. But whether he spoke at the meeting or not I
don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did Terry Pettus speak at that meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Same way with Terry Pettus. I wouldn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The witness stated that the following is the portion
of the program adopted at this meeting regarding foreign policy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Break diplomatic and economic relations with Franco Spain, withdraw United
States troops from China, and stop aid to Chiang Kai-shek, dictatorship, United
States participation in worldwide disarmament, stop manufacture of atomic
bombs and outlaw their use, abolish compulsory military training, remove from
private industry development of atomic power to insure its peaceful use for
benefit of all, restoration and extension of UNRRA, promote Big Three unity,
carry through the denazification and demilitarization programs in Germany
and Japan.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those were the policies being advocated by the Communist Party
at that time; were they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wouldn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You would not know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. I presume&mdash;if you say so, they are. I don’t
know what their particular program was at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you become acquainted with Mr. Eugene V.
Dennett, who at one time was vice president of the Washington Commonwealth
Federation&mdash;in fact held that position while you were
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He held the position of vice president when you
moved to Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t remember him at all. The only time I remember
Dennett was coming to my office as executive secretary of the
Democratic Party in the Vance Building, when he was in a military
uniform and telling me that he had been vice president of the Washington
Commonwealth Federation, but he would have been vice president
a very short period of the Commonwealth Federation because
I was there only from August of 1944 and if I remember correctly,
the Commonwealth Federation was dissolved shortly after the November
elections in 1944 and, of course, the only thing I can say about
Dennett is I can remember him coming to the office of the executive
secretary of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you aware that he was a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I certainly was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Dennett was called as a witness by this committee
at its June 1954 hearings. Mr. Dennett, when he appeared,
relied upon the fifth amendment and refused to answer questions but
later on during the hearing he came back and asked the committee to
permit him to testify. It was so near the end of the hearings that it
was impossible to hear him then. So the committee took his testimony
in March of 1955 and Mr. Dennett described his activity in the Communist
Party as a Communist Party functionary over a long period
of time and described how he got out of the Communist Party, in fact
described his expulsion and also the expulsion of his wife. He gave
the committee much valuable information.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span></p>

<p>In the course of his testimony he told the committee how a man
by the name of Lowell Wakefield was sent by the Communist Party
from New York to Seattle to engage in organizational work for the
Communist Party and that one of his chief assignments was to assist
in the organization of the Washington Pension Union.</p>

<p>Were you acquainted with Mr. Lowell Wakefield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t remember anybody by the name of Lowell
Wakefield at all. In my time, I mean my only recollection&mdash;was
Wakefield later some kind of a representative for a fish company or
operated a fish company of his own down on the waterfront?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I understood he did, but not down on the waterfront
in Washington. I think he went to Alaska.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, anyway, I think I heard about him but I
don’t think I ever met Wakefield personally, or personally knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you any knowledge of his activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My only recollection, if it is the same Wakefield,
is that he was a contributor to the Democratic Party, if it is the same
person. What I want to do, I don’t want to get myself in trouble, I
certainly didn’t know Wakefield as a Communist or knew that he was
a Communist or anything of the kind and I don’t want&mdash;my recollection
is if it is the same Wakefield he had some kind of a fish company
or was a representative for a fish company and did make contributions
to the Democratic Party while I was executive secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you acquainted with Tom Rabbitt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I was acquainted with Tom Rabbitt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He was State Senator and also an office holder in the
Washington Pension Union; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He was Washington State senator from the 35th
legislative district. He was, I think, a delegate to the King County
Democratic Central Committee from that district.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Is it a fact that the State legislature refused to seat
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t think so. I think the State legislature, before
I came to the State of Washington, refused to seat a party by the
name of Lenus Westman, elected as a State senator from up in Snohomish
County, but at least in my time nobody challenged Rabbitt’s
senator-ship.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am probably in error.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Counsel, isn’t it true both Mrs. Hartle and Eugene
Dennett testified that both Wakefield and Rabbitt were members
of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, sir. I think the record should show that William
J. Pennock was identified by Barbara Hartle not only as president
of the Washington Pension Union but as a member of the
district committee of the Communist Party for the State of Washington
and that Tom Rabbitt was likewise an officer of the Washington
Pension Union and a member of the district committee of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Isn’t it true, also, that Mr. Rabbitt appeared in executive
session in June 1954 and refused to answer questions relating to his
membership in the Communist Party and other activities along that
line, relying on the fifth amendment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is correct, sir.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span></p>

<p>Mr. O’Connell, did you confer with William Pennock and Tom
Rabbitt or any of the other leaders of the Washington Pension Union
regarding its organization, its policies, or any phases of its work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In view of the prefatory statements made by you
and by Congressman Velde, and particularly with respect to the fact
that you state that Rabbitt and Pennock were members of the district
board of the Communist Party&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Just a minute. I didn’t state that. I said two witnesses
had testified that he was a member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I see. I want to protect myself. I don’t know
whether I can safely answer that question now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What was the question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Read the question, please.</p>

<p>(The reporter read from his notes as requested.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is a real difficult one for me to answer. As
executive secretary of the Democratic Party, I probably, of course,
suggested things they might do to help us in the campaign and so on.
I don’t know, but I certainly&mdash;what I want to do&mdash;what I did was
not because they were members of the district board of the Communist
Party or because they were Communists, or anything of that kind.
If I suggested something they ought to do about the Washington
Pension Union either to Pennock or Rabbitt, it was in connection with
either Democratic Party activity or Progressive Party activity as
far as campaigns were concerned.</p>

<p>It is a very broad general question. You asked me about it, any
phases of its work. For instance, I mean we were certainly anxious
in the Democratic Party and Progressive Party, too, to get the votes
of the senior citizens of the State and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What do you mean by the “senior citizens”?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The older people of the State that were in the pension
organization, and so on. And outside the organization as well
that they had influence on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were your discussions with the leadership of the
Washington Pension Union chiefly with Pennock and Rabbitt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, during my time out there I think the Washington
Pension Union, if I remember correctly, had a whole host of
vice presidents, I don’t know how many, I think they elected&mdash;I
think Rabbitt was one of those vice presidents. But the executive
officer of the Washington Pension Union of course was Pennock and
in my work as executive secretary of the Democratic Party and also
the Progressive Party I certainly conferred with Pennock, I certainly
asked him to see that things were done by the campaign and
see that work was done in connection with it.</p>

<p>But in my time out there I think, I don’t think Rabbitt was any
kind of&mdash;was he a full-time paid employee of the Pension Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not sure what his official connection was
with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My recollection is that he was one of the many
vice presidents, I think if I recall there were about 16 vice presidents
and I think he was one of them. As far as Rabbitt and Pennock
were concerned, all of the time they were both leaders in the Democratic
Party. Rabbitt was a Democrat State senator from a legislative
district, Pennock was a representative from the same legislative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
district and likewise within the Democratic organization particularly
in King County and because King County was the largest county in
the State, the impact it would have on the State organization as well,
I was thrown into considerable contact with them in my work as
executive secretary of the Democratic Party with both Pennock and
Rabbitt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. O’Connell, both Pennock and Rabbitt were generally
known to be members of the Communist Party, as members
of the district board, were they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. I couldn’t say. I don’t think
Rabbitt acknowledged he was a member of the Communist Party and
Pennock only announced it shortly before he died. Shortly before
the beginning of the Smith Act trial in Seattle, he announced he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were quite aware, were you not, of the effort
being made by the Communist Party to take over the Washington
Pension Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know whether I&mdash;I was not in Washington
Pension Union. I was not engaged in its work or activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Any person who has held the two positions that you
have as secretary of two very active organizations would certainly
have had his finger on the pulse of general activities in the community.
You certainly knew, did you not, that the Communist Party was operating
the Washington Pension Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I certainly did not know that. I didn’t know
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You believed it, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I didn’t believe it. There are a lot of wonderful
old people in that organization and Dr. Fisher&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am talking about the leadership.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Who is the president of it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I have told you Mrs. Hartle said there were comparatively
few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Mrs. Hartle, on her own acknowledgment was a
functionary of the Communist Party, was she not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. She certainly would know whether they were working
or not, but I was not a functionary of the Communist Party and
I wouldn’t know what the Communist Party was doing as far as the
Pension Union was concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You had no inkling whatsoever that Pennock, Rabbitt,
and Mrs. Hartle were members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I had no inkling?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Suspicion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You did have a suspicion they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Upon what did you base that suspicion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I couldn’t prove it. Of course it was not my particular
job to prove it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Certainly not. No question about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In your judgment what was the purpose of the
Communist Party in attempting to capture the leadership of the
Washington Pension Union?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In my judgment what would it have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I presume, as Mrs. Hartle states there, they
were engaged in developing what she called mass organizations and
so on, and this was a large organization, there isn’t any doubt about
that, there was a very, very large group. I think the membership
of 10,000 is even underestimated. My feeling is its membership ran
closer to 16,000 just from my contact with it. I presume they would
like to control it because of its tremendous effect and tremendous influence
without any doubt. I know in the Democratic Party I wanted
to make sure that the pension union supported the candidates of the
Democratic Party. We worked hard to get them to indorse and support
Democratic Party candidates and to work for them every way we
knew how.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the leadership in the Washington Pension
Union endeavor to influence the selection of candidates for office in
either the Progressive Party or the Democratic Party while you were
secretary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Did the Washington Pension Union try&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes; through its leadership, try to influence the
selection of individuals for office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If you mean they wanted certain people elected&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not talking about supporting certain people
but did they endeavor to get certain individuals selected for
party nomination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. By that do you mean did they go out and select
certain people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the leadership in the Washington Pension
Union try to influence your party organization in behalf of certain
individuals in whom they were interested?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as the party organization was concerned,
we had the Democratic primary where the people voted in the Democratic
primary and selected the nominees and then after the Democratic
nominees were selected and so on, I would say the Washington
Pension Union with rare exceptions&mdash;and I think those exceptions
were some 9 or 10 State senators who were called quisling senators,
who didn’t support the Democratic organization in the State senate
at the time&mdash;I think the Washington Pension Union generally supported
the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Eugene Dennett testified that the purpose of
the Communist Party in exerting its infiltration efforts in both the
Washington Commonwealth Federation and the Washington Pension
Union was to strengthen its own political influence. I shall read
a part of his testimony. In referring to the Washington Commonwealth
Federation he said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It was our estimate that it was capable&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>by “our” he is referring to the Communist Party&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>that it was capable of influencing and obtaining the vote of one-third of the
members who voted in the Democratic Party slate or side of the ticket and
because of that fact and because we were in a higher state of mobilization than
the rest of the Democratic Party when primaries came along we could exercise
a more direct influence in the primaries than anybody else because our members
in the Washington Commonwealth Federation had a great zeal and a greater
devotion to carrying out their objectives than the other Democrats who frequently
relied upon making their decisions in the general election.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span></p>

<p>When asked the question why was it that the Communist Party was
so interested in obtaining control of the Washington Commonwealth
Federation, he replied:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because we wanted to ultimately obtain political power for the Communist
Party in the United States of America.</p></blockquote>

<p>Did you observe efforts made by William Pennock and Tom Rabbitt,
to get control of either the Democratic machinery, the machinery
of the Democratic Party, or the machinery of the Progressive
Party through the use of the Washington Pension Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I would say in a certain few districts in
King County, probably one district in Snohomish County, legislative
district in Grays Harbor County, that the nominees of the Democratic
Party were certainly not people that the pension union had selected
or had picked out but I think they were people the pension union supported
because of their votes in the legislature and so on. The Commonwealth
Federation was actually gone in my time. I don’t know
what it did. I don’t know what its power was and what its influence
was but for instance in the 35th District if Pennock was the Representative
and Rabbitt was the Senator and they were both in the pension
union they certainly had some influence there.</p>

<p>I am trying to think of the district in Snohomish, there are two
legislative districts there, I think it was northern Snohomish County
where I think there was a pension union member who was actually a
member and elected to the legislative assembly and I think that was
true in the district down in Grays Harbor County, but you take all
of the eastern end of Washington, all the eastern side of Washington
they certainly had no influence to speak of over there. They might
have had a tiny bit of influence in one district in Spokane County,
but in the great part, I would say in the great part of the State outside
of those few areas I picked out and where the selections were
actually people of their own membership, I don’t, I can’t see any
actual picking or selecting of people that were put in. I can’t recall
all of the people who were, but for instance the major State offices
like Governor and United States Senator, Congressman, and so on, I
couldn’t see any influence except in the First Congressional District
where of course they could have been instrumental in the nomination
and election of Hugh DeLacy in 1944 election, I think it was, but as
to the other districts, John Coffee was in Congress a long time I think,
even before the pension union was established, Charlie Levy was in
the House.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was Hugh DeLacy known to you to be a member of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. NO.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He has been identified by both Barbara Hartle and
Eugene Dennett. He was produced as a witness before the committee
in Ohio in September of last year and he refused to answer any material
questions relating to Communist Party affiliations, relying upon
the fifth amendment as the reason for so doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Senator Neuberger wrote a chapter in a book published
by Bob Allen called Our Fair City, and wrote the article in
connection with the city of Seattle, and he gives me credit in that
book, if I remember correctly, for having forced Hugh DeLacy on the
Democratic Party in the State of Washington, but Hugh DeLacy had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span>
actually been nominated for Congress on the Democratic Party ticket
before I ever went to the State of Washington.</p>

<p>He was actually the Democratic nominee.</p>

<p>Let me say, Mr. Neuberger also gives me credit for&mdash;Senator Neuberger&mdash;for
taking over. He said I took over the Democratic organization
and so on. I don’t think I did. I had served in the House with
Senator Wallgren who later became Governor and Senator Magnuson,
who was in the House, and I knew them well and Senator Mitchell,
who was secretary to Senator Wallgren at that time, and who later
became Senator and Congressman and all of that, and I think they
were appreciative of the kind of job I had done out there, and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you have any suspicion or inkling that Mr. Hugh
DeLacy was a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I couldn’t say, I wouldn’t want to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Why would you not want to say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. You see, I really didn’t get to know him. He was
elected to Congress shortly after I came out there and then he came
down here to Washington and then after his defeat for Congress he
was only back in the State of Washington a short time and went to
work, if I recall correctly, in the national office of the Progressive
Party and was working outside the State of Washington so that my
contact with DeLacy was not very great. I didn’t get to know him
like the people that were out in the State day in and day out and were
in the Democratic Party meetings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, we have the situation where the
Communist Party went deliberately about seizing the leadership and
capturing the leadership in a very powerful political organization in
the State of Washington, namely, the Washington Pension Union, and
ahead of it the Washington Commonwealth Federation. It succeeded
in capturing the leadership of it. It did it for the purpose of
advancing the interests of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Will you tell the committee whether or not the leadership of this
group, the Washington Pension Union, was successful in influencing
either of the parties of which you were secretary in any of its policy
actions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think for instance, in the Democratic Party particularly
by its organization and by its work and demands for improved
pension legislation, they had tremendous influence on the
Democratic Party. As a matter of fact the&mdash;I would say even on
the Republican Party. In the 1945 session of the State legislature
the actual legislation proposed by the pension union placing a $50
floor under old-age-pension grants and setting up a system of budget
and what-not, the legislation which they actually introduced passed
the State senate by, I think, a vote of 45 or 46 to nothing. Both
Democrats and Republicans voted for it.</p>

<p>In the House I think it passed the same way probably 102 to 1 or
105 to 3 or something like that, it was almost unanimous. In that
particular effect certainly they not only had influence with the Democratic
Party but certainly in putting legislation on the books&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What influence did it have on the Progressive
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Of course we had no power. We had no officials
of any kind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Actually, wasn’t the leadership in the Washington
Pension Union and the leadership in the Progressive Party practically
the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The leadership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, wasn’t there an overlapping leadership which
made the two practically the same?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I wouldn’t say so. Actually, it is hard to put
the picture in the pattern of that time, but the 1946 elections had been
as we all recall quite disastrous to the Democrats, there was considerable
dissension among some Democrats with President Truman, and
there was a move from Democrats generally&mdash;I would say in the
Progressive Party, as it existed particularly in 1948, the Progressive
Party was not, did not have an officialdom or even a membership that
you could say, “Well, this is identical with the Washington Pension
Union.”</p>

<p>For instance, I never held any office in the Washington Pension
Union of any kind&mdash;I was executive secretary&mdash;Russell Fluent, who
had just finished a term as Democratic treasurer was the chairman of
the Progressive Party&mdash;L. C. Hunterer, who was Democratic sheriff
in Olympia in Thurston County, was a national committeeman&mdash;and
the Democratic national committeewoman from eastern Washington,
who later became the national committeewoman of the Progressive
Party from the State of Washington. Leadership in many counties
was a leadership that moved from the county chairman and others
and moved over from the Democratic Party into the Progressive
Party.</p>

<p>The leadership of the pension union, Pennock and Fisher and Nora
McCoy, and others I recall there, if you consider Rabbitt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was Fisher’s first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Dr. C. H. Fisher. He had been president of
Northern Washington Normal College, I think, at Bellingham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, I hand you a photostatic copy of
a document and I will ask you to examine it, please, and state whether
you know what it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I understand, it purports to be a sort of a
schedule or catalog of the Pacific Northwest Labor School for what
they call its fall term of October 6 to December 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What year? 1947?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It apparently&mdash;I notice somebody made a notation
up here, 1947, but it doesn’t appear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire to offer the document in evidence, and ask
that it be marked “O’Connell Exhibit No. 1” for identification purposes
only, and made a part of the committee files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. It is so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. By reference to the exhibit it is noted that course
No. 148, offered at this school, was entitled “Northwest Labor History”
by John Daschbach, extension director, and William J. Pennock,
president of the Washington Pension Union. Will you tell the committee,
please, whether John Daschbach was known to you to be a
member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He was not.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He was not a member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He was not known to me to be a member of the
Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think the record should show he
has been identified by both Eugene Dennett and Barbara Hartle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think he was also a Smith Act defendant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As a member of the party and he was a Smith Act
defendant. He was a teacher at this school. It is observed here on
the second page that a course on trade-union organizational problems
was to be taught by a person by the name of J-a-c-k-i-n-s. What was
his first name, Harvey?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t recall Jackins too well. Was he a member
of the union, the Boeing union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not certain which union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I know there was a party by the name of Jackins
and that he was a leader in some one of the unions out there and my
best recollection is he was in the Boeing union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We have testimony before our committee that Harvey
Jackins taught at this school and I think the record should also
show Harvey Jackins was identified as a member of the Communist
Party by Elizabeth Boggs Cohen and Leonard Basil Wildman. He
was cited for contempt of the House of Representatives for refusal
to answer questions during the June 1954 hearings in Seattle and has
been convicted by a Federal court.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In that connection I want to&mdash;I notice in that
schedule that my name is listed as teaching a course in political&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes. Labor’s political role, 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I never taught such a class or roll or schedule.
Never appeared or anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Well, you were enrolled as a teacher, were you not,
in the labor school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was not. I never taught a class in the labor
school, never appeared in the labor school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What is your explanation of the advertising of the
curriculum with you as a teacher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My explanation is really easy. Mr. Daschbach got
that schedule out and later called me and asked me if I would do it
and I refused and told him I didn’t want to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He did call you and you refused?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Why did you refuse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Because I didn’t want to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was your reason for not wanting to do it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Let me see what it was. If I remember correctly,
my objection was to “tackle both ideological and organizational problems
which labor must solve to gain its ends in 1948.”</p>

<p>And my particular objection, of course, was that I had never been
involved, never was a member of a labor union or trade-union, and
I didn’t, I couldn’t speak as a laboring man or as a member of organized
labor. There was no particular way that I could particularly
expound on what labor’s role was because I wasn’t qualified to do it.
I had either been in political office or had been engaged in political
organization.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you know at that time that the Pacific Northwest
Labor School was a Communist organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What was the date of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think it was either listed earlier or later but it
had been attacked by some of the labor organizations long before it
was listed, it had been attacked by some, particularly I think the Central
Labor Council in Seattle, and had been attacked by other groups
out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Your suspicion that it was a Communist organization
was not the reason you didn’t teach the course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wouldn’t want to say now that is it. I know at
the time when he called me about it I objected to the word ideological.
I remember that expressly and I objected to the fact that I was qualified
in no way to talk about labor’s role in 1948. I was not a member
of a trade union, I had not been involved in labor organization or
anything of the kind. I know I didn’t teach there and I didn’t&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the meaning of “coordinator” after your
name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. Maybe if you let me look at it&mdash;I
don’t know what it means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did Mr. Daschbach discuss the title of coordinator
with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; he certainly did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think the record should show at
this time the Communist affiliation of other teachers in this school&mdash;Theodore
Raymond Astley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. While you are doing that I wonder if I could say
this. When I spoke up and said I knew Mr. Daschbach was a Smith
Act defendant there was some remonstrance from over here where
the press is located and I wanted to point out I left the State of
Washington in 1949 and Mr. Daschbach did not become a Smith Act
defendant, if I remember correctly, until 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I think that commotion was because they didn’t know
how to spell his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The spelling is D-a-s-c-h-b-a-c-h.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I thought maybe I had left something unexplained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Ted Astley was slated to conduct course No. 245,
psychology in the social science. He appeared as a witness before
the committee and refused to testify, relying on the fifth amendment
as to past and present Communist Party membership. He was
identified as a member of the Communist Party by Barbara Hartle.</p>

<p>Ruth Bitterman was slated to conduct a course in children’s workshop.
She refused to testify as a witness before the committee but was
identified by Barbara Hartle as a member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Jean Danielson was shown by testimony in our hearings in Seattle
to be the same person as Margaret Jean Schuddakoph, and was advertised
to conduct course No. 300, as special workshop in reading and
writing. She refused to testify before the committee and was identified
as a Communist Party member by Barbara Hartle.</p>

<p>Marjorie Daschbach was advertised to conduct course No. 304 and
was identified by Barbara Hartle as a member of the Communist
Party.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span></p>

<p>John Davis was advertised to conduct a course on workshop in the
graphic arts and was identified before this committee as having
been a member of the Communist Party by Barbara Hartle.</p>

<p>Fair Taylor, editor of Union Guardian, was advertised in the catalog
to teach a course on labor writer’s workshop. The testimony before
the committee shows that she is the same person as Fair Taylor Egroth,
and she was identified by Barbara Hartle as having been a member
of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Dr. Ralph Gundlach was advertised to conduct a course of the analysis
of employer propaganda. Were you acquainted with Dr.
Gundlach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir. He was a professor at the University
of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Dr. Gundlach was identified by Harold Sunoo,
before this committee, as having been a member of the Communist
Party. There was a course conducted on labor news reporting by a
person by the name of Pettus. Do you know his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Do I know his first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I understand, there were two Pettuses who
were newspapermen, Ken Pettus and Terry Pettus, and I am pretty
sure the party involved here is the editor of the New World, or does
it say? Ken Pettus, I think, was editor of the Stars and Stripes in
the Far Eastern area at one time, and then Terry was editor of the
New World in Seattle, Terry Pettus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you know which one taught this course on labor
news reporting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You do not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My guess would be that it would be Terry because
he was in Seattle but I don’t know whether he actually did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Terry Pettus was identified before this committee
as having been a member of the Communist Party by Elizabeth Boggs
Cohen and Barbara Hartle.</p>

<p>Did Mr. Daschbach when he called you indicate his reason for calling
you about teaching this course in the Pacific Northwest Labor
School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He thought because of my political experience and
because of the position, I think I had just shortly concluded my term
as executive secretary of the Democratic Party, that was when, in
December of 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That was in April of 1947, wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. October to December 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Anyway, he thought because of my political experience
and because of my previous position that I could do a job
and that I would be able to do it. When he told me what it was I
told him it was in a field that I was not particularly qualified to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. The committee will stand in recess until 2 o’clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:10 p. m., the committee was recessed, to reconvene
at 2 p. m. the same day.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span></p>

<h2>AFTERNOON SESSION, JUNE 1, 1955</h2>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. Let the record show that the legal quorum of the subcommittee
is present, Mr. Velde, of Illinois, and Mr. Doyle, of California.</p>

<p>Mr. Tavenner, will you proceed, please.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF JEREMIAH JOSEPH O’CONNELL&mdash;Resumed</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, were you acquainted with Robert
Marshall during his lifetime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What were the circumstances under which you became
acquainted with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Robert Marshall at the time of my original acquaintance
with him was chief of the reclamation division of the forestry
service. He had begun his early career in the forestry service at
Missoula, Mont., which was located in my Congressional District, the
First or Western Congressional District of Montana.</p>

<p>Shortly after I came back to Washington to take my seat in 1937,
Robert Marshall came to my office and introduced himself and told
me that because he had started his career in the forestry service out
there he had always had an interest in the district particularly because
of its large forestry holdings, large forestry provisions, and he and
I became close friends, socially, I would say more socially than anything
else. I think he died about a year and a half or maybe two years
after I&mdash;I can’t remember whether he died in 1938 or 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. His will was probated in 1940.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think that is correct. His death was probably in
1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you one of the witnesses to his will?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did he discuss with you at the time of the making
of his will or prior thereto the purpose he had in mind in setting up
a trust in which you were named as one of the trustees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, he had never discussed&mdash;in fact, I really did
not know that Bob Marshall had any money. He lived very ordinarily,
didn’t give any indication he had any money. I was back out
in Butte, Mont., and I had been defeated for Congress and I got a
notice from the surrogate court in New York that I was named trustee
in the will and I thought I had come into a lot of money. I was sent a
copy of the will and I was named as trustee of what later became the
Robert Marshall Foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The will authorized you and the other trustees to
apply the income derived from the trust and such parts of the principal
as the trustees in their own unlimited discretion deemed necessary
for the following objects and purposes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The education of the people of the United States of America to the necessity
and desirability of the development and organization of unions of persons engaged
in work or of unemployment and unemployed persons, and the promotion
and advancement of an economic system in the United States based upon the
theory of production for use and not for profit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Did it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is correct.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That part of the will which related to the education
of the people of the United States to the necessity and desirability of
developing and organizing unions of persons engaged in work was
actually considered by the trustees as more or less window dressing,
wasn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No it was the other way around, Mr. Tavenner.
I don’t know when Bob Marshall prepared this will, but I think Mr.
Doyle would know about this, Upton Sinclair had his so-called epic
movement in California, and there was a lot of discussion of an economy
based on production for use rather than for profit and in the first
meeting of the trustees that we held there was actually a resolution
passed where the rather untenable idea of getting a production-for-use
economy in the United States was discussed and it was decided by the
trustees that the money should actually be employed to develop as
much as we could the organization of trade unions, development and
organization of trade unions, organizing of unemployed people, and
actually for the development of a cooperation between farmers and
workers, farmers and labor, so that instead of having a division of interests
as far as they were concerned, and the trustees laid down a rule
that with reference to grants, that in order to come within what the
trustees considered the provisions of the will as the development of
trade unions was concerned, that the grants would have to be made for
some trade-union purpose, or development of trade unions, and so
on, and that was what was actually done by the trustees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were there occasions when grants were made on
that theory&mdash;on that principle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. On what principle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The one you just named.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Actually, as far as I can remember&mdash;and of course
this goes back a long, long time, from 1940 on&mdash;I can’t remember all of
the organizations but we usually had an annual meeting of the trustees
and applications were made to the trustees by practically&mdash;I mean just
hundreds of organizations around the country that applied to foundations
of this kind, and I think, I can’t remember any exceptions, I
don’t recall any now.</p>

<p>As closely as we could the applications were considered from the
point of view that the money was to be applied by the organization
to whom it was granted to help the organization and development of
trade unions and organizing of unemployed people and particularly
the development of a principle of cooperation between farmers and
laborers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. But actually the will did provide for the use of the
money for promotion and advancement of an economic system in the
United States based upon the theory of production for use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I think another thing that would lend some
stability to what I am saying is that I think the tax bureau at one of
the local Federal district courts in determining the taxability of the
foundation itself actually I think handed down a ruling that the foundation
was not entitled to a section 101 exemption because that particular
provision actually called for the elimination of the capitalistic
system. I think that was the wording used either by the bureau or
the court and from that time on the trustees never actually, I can’t
think of a single organization or a single group&mdash;and we had applications
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
I know, I am trying to think of some of the organizations that
existed over that period of time&mdash;I can’t recall any of them now who
specifically asked for grants based on what they called theory of production
for use rather than for profit. But I can’t think of a single
instance where the trustees actually made&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That was actually the system in use in the Soviet
Union, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I have never been in the Soviet Union and I am
not&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. However, you know, that is true, don’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My information that I get from reading and so on
is that there is a modification. I think if I state it correctly in the
industrial field I think there is production for use rather than for
profit, but as I understand the Soviets have now abandoned as far as
particular foreign farm production is concerned&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it not the purpose of the Communist Party
in the United States at that time to foist upon this country just such
a plan, namely, to establish a Communist system of production for
use and not for profit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I, of course, wouldn’t be qualified to say, I wouldn’t
be qualified to state whether or not that was their purpose or their
program.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the program of the Communist Party as I
remember it before I came to Congress, while I was in Congress and
after the program of the Communist Party in the United States was
fluctuating&mdash;as a matter of fact, I think there was a removal of Browder
because he was advocating&mdash;removal of Browder by the Communist
Party leadership because he was advocating a companionship
or partnership with capital and that capital and communism could
exist and there could be as I understand it&mdash;that was the program of
the Communist Party for a long time until he was removed, I can’t
remember when.</p>

<p>But I knew Bob Marshall those years&mdash;I think I can positively
state that Bob Marshall was not a Communist and that the provisions
in that will and certainly the people that were named as trustees in
addition to the trade union trust as we called it, the Marshall Foundation
Trust, there was a civil liberties trust of which I think Roger
Baldwin was the head and I think everyone will agree he is decidedly
anti-Communist.</p>

<p>There was also a wilderness area trust. In fact, out in the State of
Montana there is a great wilderness area named the Robert Marshall
Wilderness Area after Robert Marshall.</p>

<p>My distinct feeling about that is that in talking with Bob and talking
to him that he was caught up in the period of the depression situation
where there were all kinds of economic theories advanced at
the time, not only New Deal but all kinds of other movements and I
don’t think there was actually any connection in Bob Marshall’s mind
between what the Communist Party might be advocating at that time
and what he actually put in his will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. May I ask this about that will? Was it a typewritten
will or a will written by him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Actually his brother, Jim Marshall, is an attorney
in the city of New York and I think a member of the New York City
Board of Education and the will was actually prepared by Jim
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
Marshall’s firm, I can’t remember all who are in it, but the copy which
I got was actually a copy of the will which I received through the
surrogate court in New York, actually a printed form.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, you mentioned the fact that tax
exempt status of the trust was removed by action of the court. Was
that a result of action taken by the Internal Revenue Bureau?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it after the Internal Revenue Bureau learned
of the type of grants being made under this trust that it took the action
it did to remove the tax exemption status of the trust?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My best recollection, Mr. Tavenner, is that Congressman
Dies made a speech on the floor, and if I remember correctly,
in which he discussed the Robert Marshall Foundation in which he
went into the various grants that we had made and shortly after that,
on whose initiative I don’t know, the Bureau took up with the foundation
the matter of its one exemption and the Bureau exemption was
removed and I believe as trustees we appealed it to the courts and the
courts decided against us.</p>

<p>We appealed, I am sure the briefs will show that we appealed to
the courts on the basis that the grants were being made for the purpose
of organizing and developing of trade unions and for organization
of unemployed people and not for the theory of production for use
rather than for profit. I am sure the briefs will bear me out on that.
I of course had nothing to do with the preparation of them.</p>

<p>George Marshall, who is Bob Marshall’s brother, was the manager
of the trust funds and as I said, the trustees usually met annually,
once a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were aware, were you not, that the Communist
Party in the State of Washington just 2 years prior to the probate of
this will, endeavored or at least proposed a plan for legislation to set
up exactly the same type of economy in the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew nothing about that. The first time I ever
went to the State of Washington in August 1944&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Robert Marshall you say was from the State of
Montana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, Robert Marshall was actually a New Yorker,
his dad was Louis Marshall, a partner of Samuel Untermyer, outstanding
corporation lawyer in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was a great deal of his experience in the forestry
service on the west coast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; 3 years of his service in the Forestry Department
were at Missoula, Mont., but not on the west coast. We are in
the Rocky Mountain area, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Is this within the scope of the hearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. The Robert Marshall Foundation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I think it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. We will take a short recess.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>(Committee members present after recess: Representatives Doyle
and Scherer.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. The committee will come to order and let the record
show that the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Walter, appointed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
a different subcommittee to continue this hearing today, consisting of
Mr. Moulder, Mr. Doyle, and Mr. Scherer, of Ohio, and that Mr.
Scherer and Mr. Doyle are both present, a legal majority of the new
subcommittee.</p>

<p>Mr. O’Connell, will you please rise and be sworn again.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, I referred to the proposal sponsored
by the Communist Party in the State of Washington in 1936 for
the enactment of a law establishing production-for-use initiative as
it was called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That was stolen from Upton Sinclair’s legislation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And possibly also from the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t propose to speak for the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you propose to speak for Mr. Upton Sinclair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew Mr. Sinclair quite well and he used to contribute
to my campaign and I had some opportunity to see his campaign
in California.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Eugene V. Dennett described a convention of the
Washington Commonwealth Federation, held in April 1936 in Everett,
Wash., and the part that the Communist Party played in that convention.
His testimony relating to this particular matter is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was another matter which arose as a serious issue in that convention
and it concerned a proposal for an initiative measure which became known as
the production-for-use initiative. Many people, because of the Communist Party
influence in the unemployed days, were quite concerned and alarmed over the
problem of unemployment, insecurity, possible impoverishment, et cetera. All
the consequences of economic dislocation. They had read many of the so-called
utopian pieces of literature such as Bellamy’s Looking Backward and other
documents of the kind. They had also read Mr. Upton Sinclair’s Program in California.
They were somewhat acquainted with the propaganda of the Soviet
Union to the effect that production for use was the solution to the problems of
capitalist lack of planning. In other words, planned economy.</p>

<p>The story on the production-for-use initiative is simply this: Because there
was such a popular demand for some change in the economic situation to assure
continued production and a cooperative effort, many people tried to translate
an ideal of a cooperative commonwealth into some form of legislative effort.
This resulted in many conferences and the calling in of legal talent to try to
draft a measure which would be legal and which would satisfy the ambitions
of the people to have the so-called dream of a cooperative commonwealth
organization.</p>

<p>Question. Now, at that point describe a little more fully what production
for use meant in a practical sense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. I wish I could satisfy you completely on that point, because
that is one of the problems we ran into in trying to draw up this initiative
measure. We could never satisfy ourselves that we had it satisfactorily organized.
However, the staff who worked on it worked long and hard and finally
produced a measure which was known as the production-for-use initiative. It
was ready for presentation to that convention. However, some of us in the
Communist Party, while we agreed that such a measure was a good propaganda
weapon and felt that it was an excellent means of popularizing the ideas which
we understood and claimed were the basis of the operation of the economy in
the Soviet Union, we were startled when we read the document and found that
it sounded a little bit more like the Fascist corporate state that the Italian
leader Mussolini had established. We became so alarmed about it and we were
so perplexed that we asked a very world famous person who happened to be
a guest of the convention what this person thought about it. The person to
whom I refer is Anna Louise Strong, who had just come from the Soviet Union,
extended greetings to the convention and otherwise gave a very enlightening
report on her travels and won wide acclaim for that effort.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span></p>

<p>Question. Did she on the floor of the convention address herself to the problem
of production for use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. She did not. Not at that moment. She spoke only in general
terms about the referring to it in a complimentary way and hoping for success,
but at that moment she did not know very much about what was in that document.
However, we felt that she, coming from the Soviet Union with fresh
knowledge, might know quite a lot about it and might be able to assist us in
revising the document so that it would be possible to satisfy us that it was in
fact a step in the right direction of a cooperative commonwealth. So she consented
very graciously to take the document and work on it overnight. She did
exactly that and we read it the next morning and much to our surprise she
had moved the emphasis in the control even more in the direction of top control
and less in the direction of allowing the members or the organization to have
anything to say about it, which was just the reverse of the trend that we had
hoped for.</p>

<p>Consequently we began to ask ourselves, that is, the Communists asked themselves,
if this is the end result of an effort to draw up an initiative maybe it
would be smarter politically for us to see that the measure died a-borning.
Consequently we came to the conclusion that it was impossible to draw up an
initiative measure which would be adequate and which would answer our
propaganda needs and our desires to satisfy us that it was in harmony with
our program. So we embarked upon a campaign in the course of the election.</p>

<p>Question. Was this a campaign to pass the proposed bill or to defeat it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. We all went out presumably to win support, to get the measure
adopted. That is, it was an initiative measure and it was before the voters.
The voters were to cast a vote “yes” or “no” on this initiative. The Communist
Party found itself in that predicament.</p>

<p>We were committed to support the measure but we were determined to bring
about its defeat. Consequently, we campaigned far and wide all over the State
of Washington explaining the measure in such a way as to convince the people
that they should not vote for it. At the same time we represented ourselves as
campaigning for the measure and we did it so successfully that the measure
was defeated. If we had not have done it I am afraid it would have been
adopted.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Sounds like he needs a mental examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I think it is rather consistent with Communist
Party tactics.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. My counsel asked me who was “we.” I am referring to the
Communist Party in that instance, the leaders of the Washington Commonwealth
Federation were terribly disturbed by the nature of the campaign we
were carrying on&mdash;that is, the Communists.</p>

<p>Question. I should think it would be a rather confusing campaign where the
Communist Party in order to defeat it actually supported it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true. It was a very confusing to every one, even to us
at times.</p>

<p>Question. That is a very interesting thing. The Communist Party in order
to defeat this measure went out and conducted a statewide campaign in favor
of it but in order to accomplish its defeat, if I understand you correctly, it so
represented the issues that people would be bound to vote against it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. That is true. There is triple deception in this maneuver,
which is rather hard to follow. I hope I have explained it.</p>

<p>Question. I am afraid that the point may not be absolutely clear in the record,
and I want to be sure that it is clear.</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, it was not the fact that the Communist Party
was supporting this measure that caused its defeat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. You are correct, sir; that was not the reason. It was the way
we as disguised Communists carried on the campaign, ostensibly for it, but in
fact against it.</p>

<p>Question. In other words, your representations were of such a character as
to make known the weaknesses in the bill and the person would actually think
you were supporting it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dennett</span>. True. You understand it quite clearly.</p>

<p>Question. I hope so. I think the bill was properly named when you used the
word “initiative” because that certainly is the use of initiative. I am glad to
know it is Communist Party initiative. It is a very deceptive type of campaign.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span></p></blockquote>

<p>That was the history of production for use as first sponsored by
the Communist Party until they found that it was not workable to
reduce to a form of legislative enactment in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In 1936.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In 1936.</p>

<p>And yet the will of Robert Marshall was prepared 2 years later in
1938, and it embraces the same principle of the promotion and advancement
of an economic system in the United States based upon
the theory of production for use. And you were one of the trustees
of that foundation.</p>

<p>Do you know of any connection or any influence brought upon Robert
Marshall to establish this trust fund for the changing of the system
of economy in the United States which had its origin in the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I know absolutely none. As I said earlier, and
I am sure Bob had no connection with the Washington situation
that you have read about in detail. I think like a great many others
in that depression period, there were all kinds of discussions of
panaceas to solve the economic situation that existed at the time.
I am positive that Bob Marshall was not a member of the Communist
Party, that he was not influenced by the Communists in the preparation
of that will or the provisions that are in it, and as a trustee I
want to assure you that I can’t think of a single instance, a single
instance where any grant of any money was made to any organization
to begin an economy based on production for use or propagandize
it or publicize it or anything.</p>

<p>I can remember at one time the National Farmers Union came to
the foundation, Mr. Patton, the national president, particularly presented
the proposal and wanted to establish branch centers throughout
the United States trying to some extent bring about what he called
a cooperative movement and an economy based upon cooperatives.
I think he wanted an immediate expenditure of some $160,000 and
it was rejected by the trustees. I know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you acquainted with Lem Harris?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I was not acquainted with Lem Harris.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think I know who he is. Wasn’t he in the
Department of Agriculture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He was in the Department of Agriculture. He
spent many years in the Soviet Union, studying and working in the
field of agriculture. He was prominent in organizations interested in
agriculture in this country. He was before this committee and refused
to testify as to his prior or present Communist Party membership,
relying upon the fifth amendment. He was considered the head of
the agricultural division of the Communist Party in the United
States.</p>

<p>Did he importune in behalf of the National Farmers Union in procuring
grants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He particularly never talked to me or never asked
me to do it. I don’t know whether&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You don’t need to put it on such a personal basis.
As a trustee you know whether he did or did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. As a trustee, Gardner Jackson,
who I think was employed by the National Farmers Union, actually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
talked more and actually guided the trust or the foundation as far as
agricultural matters were concerned, and I, of course, all I&mdash;I never
met Lem Harris.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You wouldn’t have to meet Lem Harris to know
what influence he had to bear upon the making of grants by your
trustees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I know of no influence he had, particularly as far
as I am concerned. He never importuned me at any time to vote for
anybody or grant any money to any organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Gardner Jackson is alleged to have written a letter
on August 3, 1946, to James G. Patton, president of the National
Farmers Union. Mr. Lem Harris admitted that he had seen a copy
of that letter when he testified before this committee. In this letter to
Mr. Patton, Gardner Jackson makes this statement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I don’t have to tell you that many of us understand your appointment of the
pathetic Communist or pro-Communist boy Phil Reno to your headquarters staff
in Denver as political and labor relations official was at the behest of George
Marshall and Lem Harris, the Communist Party’s avowed agricultural policy
fellow, in order to insure a continuing flow of money from the Marshall Foundation
to the National Farmers Union.</p></blockquote>

<p>Doesn’t that prove to you the influence that was exerted by the Communist
Party upon awards made to the National Farmers Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That, of course, is a statement made by Gardner
Jackson, I think after he had been removed from his position with the
Farmers Union, and in which he supplied information to Senator
Bridges, I think, and I can’t remember others, but what influence&mdash;for
instance I don’t even know who Phil Reno is, don’t know anything
about him, and what Jackson is attempting there I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You had a responsibility as one of the trustees to
know how the awards were being paid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is right and, as a matter of fact, the foundation
called Patton before it because we got in disagreement with him
about the way the funds were being expended and from then on grants
were made to the various State organizations of the Farmers Union
rather than to the national office directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. But they were continued?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, they were actually made to different State
farm union organizations but not to the National Farmers Union,
not to Patton. And certainly one of the basic reasons was because of
this gigantic proposal that he had about establishing these branch
centers. We just didn’t think it was a wise expenditure of the foundation’s
funds, and so on, and that was some of the disagreement that
we had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you ever see a copy of the letter which I referred
to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Had you heard of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think the way I heard of it, I don’t know whether
this is the same letter, but Senator Bridges made a speech on the floor
of the Senate I think in 1950 in which I am pretty sure he quoted or
actually inserted the Gardner Jackson letter, if I remember, and I
think I read it within Senator Bridges remarks at that time that
were on the floor.</p>

<p>Now, I remember that there was quite a to-do about it. I was out
in the State of Montana at that time. I have been close. I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_532">532</span>
known the Farm Union leadership and members out there and I
know they were exercised and committed and worried about this
whole development.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall from that letter, and the discussions
which you have just mentioned, that Lem Harris, whom I have identified
from the committee files as a person prominent in the agricultural
section of the Communist Party, was himself attempting to decide
what awards or what grants the trustees of the foundation should
make to the National Farmers Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t recall as far as I am concerned any influence
on me. I voted as far as I was concerned on those grants the
way I wanted to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I understand that, but I am asking you about your
knowledge and what you learned in the course of the performance of
your duties as a trustee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as Lem Harris was concerned, I never
heard anything about Lem Harris’ influence or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have just told us there was a great disturbance
in 1950 when this information became public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Over the Gardner Jackson letter; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. So you did not know something about it in 1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; but I mean from 1950 on there had been no
meetings of the Robert Marshall Foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me quote further from this same letter, in
which Mr. Gardner Jackson is addressing Mr. Patton:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I do not have to recall to your mind&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>meaning Mr. Patton’s mind&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Lem Harris’ visit to you in Denver a few years ago to tell you that of the total
amount of money remaining in the Marshall Foundation, the National Farmers
Union would be allowed so much and to ask you as president of the National
Farmers Union how you wanted that sum spread over the ensuing few years.</p>

<p>Lem Harris is not a trustee of that fund.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you know anything about that? Does that refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It doesn’t mean anything to me. I was not close
to Patton of course. I don’t know what he was doing as far as Lem
Harris was concerned, I mean I just don’t know anything about that.
I am telling you that very frankly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have been very positive in your statements that
no awards or grants were made by this foundation which might be construed
as being grants to or for the benefit of the Communist Party.
That has been the inference of your testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, that is what I am trying&mdash;of course the questions
all have been with reference to the economic system based on
production for use rather than for profit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. And all that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You trustees had very broad powers to determine
what organization you would aid in the purpose of this trust which
was, namely, to promote an economic system in the United States based
upon profit for use. I am trying to find out how you exercised those
broad powers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_533">533</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Those powers were exercised by different trustees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Of which you were one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Of which I was one. All of us exercised I am sure
our independent judgment on it. If it were possible to bring them
all here, I don’t have them, but there were many instances where the
trustees divided, where these grants were made by majority vote
rather than by full vote and so on.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of situations that exist. But as far as I am
concerned, Lem Harris never influenced me to make a grant to the
Farmers Union or to any organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Don’t misunderstand me again. My question is
broader than the influencing of you. My question is whether or not
it influenced the action of the trustees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Of course I don’t know whether Lem Harris went
out and met with Jim Patton and Gardner Jackson, who was a
trustee. I don’t know whether that actually took place. I don’t know
whether he did these other things that are said. I don’t know whether
he did them or not, but if he did those things and Jackson was going
along then he had some influence and so on. But I think Jim Patton
became leader of the National Farmers Union after I left Congress.
I never got to know him real well, I think I have been introduced to
him maybe once or twice. I know that Jim Patton was displeased
with some of my votes on the foundation which were evidently reported
to him by Jackson and went to the leadership of the Farmers
Union in Montana to try to exercise influence as far as I was concerned
in my votes on the foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you have any other groups attempting to
influence your judgment or decision in the matter of making grants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Any other groups?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes; or individuals.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, over the period of years from 1940 on down
there were all kinds of grants made and there have been various
individuals who have come to me in connection with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And many of those people were leaders in notorious
Communist-front organizations; weren’t they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, of course I don’t go along with your description
of notorious Communist-front organizations. Many of the
people came to me and asked me to vote for grants for causes and for
principles which I thought were right and which I thought ought to
be done, and if they were right in my opinion I thought they were
right, I voted for them and if they were not I voted against them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Well, for instance, was a grant made of $20,000 to
be used in the payment of attorney’s fees for the defense of William
Robert Remington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Not by the Marshall Foundation, by the trust funds
that I was a trustee of. We certainly made no grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was any money of the foundation&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think, isn’t that in connection with the civil-liberties
trust? It is not in connection with the trade-union trust.
Isn’t that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That was paid out from another fund in the same
trust, not from the one in which&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. The will established, I think I can explain it,
the will established three trusts, one that was called the Robert Marshall
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_534">534</span>
Foundation, we were denoted always as the trade-union trust.
The second trust was a civil-liberties trust and 5 trustees, not all of
the 5 trustees on the trade-union trust, were trustees on the civil-liberties
trust. There were 15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you on both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I was only on the trade union trust.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you have any knowledge of the payment from
this other trust&mdash;that is, the civil-liberties trust&mdash;of the grant of
$20,000 for defense of Remington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I know nothing about it except, was that contained
in Mr. Dies’ speech? Was that reported&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really personally have no&mdash;I am not a member of
that civil-liberties trust and I don’t know. There is also a wilderness
area trust that is set up in the will and I am not a trustee on that
fund either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the only fund of which you were a trustee the
one which provided for the promotion of an economic system in the
United States based upon the theory of production for use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Which the trustees abandoned and decided to
eliminate at the very first meeting of the trustees that was held.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let us see the nature of the grants and we can determine
more about whether they did actually abandon it or not. How
long did this trust continue to operate? How long was it active?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think we actually made grants from, if I remember
correctly, 1940 until 1950. I am not sure whether we made any
grants in 1950 or not. We have not met in the last 5 years, I know
that. If I remember correctly, there is approximately $41,000 left
in the fund of which I am a trustee and there have been no meetings
of the trustees in at least the last 4 or 5 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The committee has information that grants were
made in 1941 and 1942 by the Robert Marshall Foundation to the
American Youth Congress for the total of $10,250. Do you know
who solicited those grants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. An actual application would be made to Mr.
George Marshall as manager of the trust by the organization that was
involved&mdash;by the American Youth Congress. I can’t recall the reason
for the grant. My offhand guess would be that the American Youth
Congress was proposing to establish some kind of a labor secretary
or labor division of the Youth Congress or something, and they would
tie it in actually to the provision of the will as far as the trade union,
development of trade unions were concerned, organization of unemployed
youth, I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you, as a trustee, do anything to ascertain how
the money was being used after the grants were made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I never did actually as a trustee. We had the
organization report to us from time to time how they were expending
the funds and what they were doing, but I couldn’t personally take
any one of those grants and tell you actually what the report was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The American Youth Congress has been cited as
a subversive and Communist organization by Attorney General Tom
Clark on December 4, 1947, and September 21, 1948, under a citation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_535">535</span>
by Attorney General Francis Biddle September 24, 1942, and also,
May 28, 1942, it was stated in the citation that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It originated in 1934 and has been controlled by the Communists and manipulated
by them to influence the thought of American youth.</p></blockquote>

<p>It was cited by the Special Committee on Un-American Activities
June 29, 1942, January 3, 1939, January 3, 1941, and again on March
29, 1944, in which it was stated that it was one of the principal fronts
of the Communist Party and prominently identified with the White
House picket line under the immediate auspices of the American
Peace Mobilization.</p>

<p>Do you know whether Jack R. McMichael was the national chairman
of the American Youth Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I couldn’t recall&mdash;the name doesn’t mean anything
to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did he play any part in the solicitation of these
grants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as I was concerned, he didn’t at least to me.
If his name was on the stationery, I got a copy of the application
and all that, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not certain that he was its president at the
time those grants were made, but he may have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During the same period, according to the committee’s
information, grants totaling $3,250 were made to the Federated
Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And subsequently increased to a total of $29,200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know whether those totals are correct, but
I know grants were made consistently to the Federated Press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were the grants sufficiently large to make these
figures within reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I would say they are. They never got a large
grant each year. I think they got small grants like $3,500 or something
of that kind. It could have totaled $29,000 over the years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That organization was cited on March 29, 1944, by
the Special Committee on Un-American Activities as a Communist-controlled
organization financed by the American Fund for Public
Service and the Robert Marshall Foundation, both principal sources
of funds for Communist enterprises.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. There are a lot of conclusions drawn there that need
proof.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I think we are proceeding to prove it right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Federated Press was a press service that operated
in the labor field. It supplied labor papers throughout the country
with labor news, news about labor, and about things labor was doing
and we thought certainly was entitled to a grant from the point of
view of development and organization of trade unions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It was a principal supplier of the Daily Worker and
the Daily People’s World.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wouldn’t know, but I would presume that they
probably&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You didn’t inquire?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_536">536</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Probably did. As far as I was concerned the Federated
Press was doing an excellent job in the labor field. As a Congressman,
of course, I had excellent opportunity to get all of the labor
newspapers and the labor newspapers particularly in my district, and
they were getting news from the Federated Press that covered a want
that was sorely needed as far as labor information was concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you know that the American Youth Congress
had been cited as a Communist-front organization at the time you
acted upon&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. By the Attorney General of the United States, both
Attorney General Clark and Attorney General Biddle and by this
committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as I was concerned, I am pretty sure I had
knowledge they were cited by Attorney General Clark and by Attorney
General Biddle or by any other attorney general, but that didn’t
determine in my mind&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That did not serve to put you on inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That did not serve as far as I was concerned to
make it conclusive by any means, and if I in my personal opinion
thought they were doing a good job and doing a job within the provisions
of this will and so on, I voted for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Would you have made a grant to the Communist
Party in the State of Washington which as shown by the testimony
I read to you was interested in enacting into law the same principle
under which this trust was being operated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I told you that at the very beginning, at the very
first meeting that the trustees held, that we voted not to make any
grants that were asked for on the basis of being used for the promotion
of an economy based on production for use rather than for profit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That would have been in violation of the provisions
of the will, wouldn’t it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, sir; we made our grants within the first provisions,
within the provision that provided for the development and the
organization of workers and unemployed persons and so on. We made
it a strictly trade-union trust.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In other words, you entirely disregarded this provision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. And if the Communist Party or the Democratic
Party or Republican Party or any partisan organization came and
asked for funds they wouldn’t have gotten it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. But if it was an organization which the leadership
of the Communist Party had captured and had under its control, it
would be perfectly all right to make an award?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The organization never, I mean the foundation
never went out and conducted any Red hunt or went out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Never took any precautionary measures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Don’t put words in my mouth. We never went
out and conducted any kind of a Red hunt, we never investigated the
organization to see what they were doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Didn’t you make any investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. When they said we want to do so and so in the
labor field. We wanted to do this or that, if it was within the provisions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_537">537</span>
of the will and in the minds of the majority of the trustees
something we felt ought to be done, the grant was made. If we didn’t,
it wasn’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You said you didn’t make a Red hunt, witch hunt,
I am not sure which you stated. Red hunt. But actually you didn’t
make any investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As to whether or not this organization had Reds
in it or Communists in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As to whether it was a Communist-controlled organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, we didn’t make any such investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Why didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It wasn’t our job to do anything of that kind.
As a matter of fact, I am sure, Mr. Tavenner, you have been around
here a long time, and I mean the development as far as these organizations
are concerned that you are talking about to me now, the proscription
of these organizations, certain individuals, are things that
have gone on. I went into this foundation selected solely as a friend
of Bob Marshall’s. I went in with an honest mind determined to do
the best job I knew how to see that the money was spent to do what
I thought Bob would like to have seen done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Bob unquestionably wanted to promote a new economic
system in the United States based on the theory of production.
That is what Bob wanted to do according to his last will and testament.</p>

<p>Did you make grants aggregating $6,000 to Frontier Films?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am pretty sure we did. I can’t recall the particular
grant now or know what it was made for. I think there was
a particular picture. Wasn’t the picture of 1937 Little Steel strike
out in Chicago where many of the workers were murdered? You
see it is very difficult to go back 17 or 18 years and try to put it in
the pattern that you now work on today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We know that Frontier Films produced the Communist
film Native Land based on Richard Wright’s Native Son. The
picture featured the Negro actor, Paul Robeson. That is the only
information that I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I know as far as Frontier Films were concerned
whatever the picture was, as I recall, it was a labor picture and my
best recollection is it was the picture about the Little Steel strike
and particularly the Memorial Day massacre in 1937 at Republic Steel
in Chicago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall who solicited the grant?</p>

<p>Frontier Films was cited by this committee as a Communist front
on March 29, 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, the first name of Paul comes to my mind. I
can’t remember any last name. The party came and talked to us
about it&mdash;was there a Paul&mdash;Paul comes to my mind. That is all
I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Grants totaling $900 were made to the International
Juridical Association. Do you recall the circumstances under
which that grant was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I really can’t recall the circumstances now.
It is apparently a very small grant. I don’t know what it was used
for. It must have been in connection with some particular labor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_538">538</span>
legal problem that may have been involved as far as the Wagner Act
was concerned or NLRB or something of that nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Grants totaling $4,250 were made to the National
Federation for Constitutional Liberties. That is an organization you
did know about; isn’t it? In fact, the amount was increased after
1942 to a total of $56,000. You were acquainted with that organization;
weren’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew of the National Federation for Constitutional
Liberties, yes, and I am sure that grants were made, I would
say on an annual basis to the National Federation, I don’t know what
amounts specifically, but whether that total amount is correct or not
I cannot say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you familiar with the citation of that organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I am not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me read it to you. It was cited as subversive
and Communist by Attorney General Tom Clark on December 4,
1947; it was also cited by Attorney General Francis Biddle September
24, 1942, in the following language:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Part of what Lenin called the solar system of organizations, ostensibly having
no connection with the Communist Party, by which Communists attempt to
create sympathizers and supporters of their program. It was established as a
result of a conference on constitutional liberties held in Washington, D. C.,
June 7-9, 1940. The defense of Communist leaders such as Sam Darcy and
Robert Wood, party secretaries for Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, have been
major efforts of the federation.</p></blockquote>

<p>What purpose did the trustees of your foundation have in making
$56,000 of grants to that organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, of course, if I had the specific application
before me I could tell you, but I am sure that the application set out
that it would be used for the defense of various labor leaders who
were under attack of any kind, particularly from the civil liberties
point of view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Communist or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Communist or non-Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were actually one of the sponsors for the call
to the conference, in June of 1940, which was alluded to in the citation
by Attorney General Biddle; were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know whether I was. If my name is there,
I was, and of course I was all for any organization that was fighting
for constitutional liberties and still am, any organization that fights
for them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long did you remain associated with the
National Federation for Constitutional Liberties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Associated with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In what capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In any capacity. You were a sponsor of the call
for the constitutional liberties conference which gave birth to the
National Federation for Constitutional Liberties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I imagine I was a sponsor as long as it took to
sponsor the call. I don’t know how long that might be. But I had
no office in the National Federation.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_539">539</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How was your assistance as a sponsor in this movement
obtained?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Have you got a list of the officers of the federation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I would presume&mdash;if you had a list of the officers&mdash;I
presume I was contacted through the officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you aware that this organization merged with
the International Labor Defense, another arm or branch of the Communist
Party, to form the Civil Rights Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My information is that the Civil Rights Congress
was formed from a merger of these two organizations. That is as
I understand it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Our information is that the Civil Rights Congress
was given grants totaling $63,500. Are you familiar with those
grants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am sure the Civil Rights Congress was given
grants. Whether or not that total figure is correct or not I couldn’t
say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Civil Rights Congress was cited as subversive and
Communist by Attorney General Tom Clark in 1947 and in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I understand, they now are going through proceedings
before the Board to determine whether or not they are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, whether or not they will be required to register.
That is the provision of law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I mean the determination of whether or not they
register is whether or not they are a Communist-front organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. They are probably making the defense that they are
not required to.</p>

<p>Did you also make grants totaling $10,125 to the National Negro
Congress which subsequently was increased to $54,530?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That sounds&mdash;I am sure grants were made to the
National Negro Congress for the employment of a labor secretary to
work particularly on the organizing of both working and unemployed
Negroes in the Southern States. I am sure that was done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you aware that that organization was cited
as subversive and Communist by the Attorney General Tom Clark, on
December 4, 1947, and again on September 21, 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Do you know when our grants were made to the
National Negro Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, from 1942 until March 1951.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, then, I am sure that, I feel sure we knew it
had been cited. As I said before, of course mere citations by the
Attorney General is not sufficient&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It wasn’t sufficient to put you on inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It wasn’t sufficient at least in my mind to proscribe
that organization, and I think history and subsequent events have
proved that it is necessary to go a little further than just to have the
Attorney General put organizations on a list.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You say a little further? You didn’t go any further,
did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as we were concerned, as I told you when
an organization came to us they came to us with the specific application
for funds for a specific purpose and we never&mdash;as a matter of fact,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_540">540</span>
we never permitted the organization to appear before the foundation
or any representative of the organization. We went into the matter
ourselves. We conducted no investigations to determine what their
political beliefs might be or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You made the awards regardless of the purpose
behind the formation of the organization; is that what it comes down
to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. For instance, we never went, we never sent out
a group of investigators, never had the funds, as a matter of fact, to
do that to find out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. If you had read the citation of Attorney General
Francis Biddle, for instance, which was made on September 24, 1942,
you would have learned as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A. Philip Randolph, president of the congress since its inception in 1936, refused
to run again in April 1940 on the ground that it was deliberately packed with
Communists and Congress of Industrial Organization members who were either
Communists or sympathizers with Communists.</p>

<p>Commencing with its formation in 1936, Communist Party functionaries and
fellow travelers have figured prominently in the leadership and affairs of the
congress. According to A. Phillip Randolph, John P. Davis, secretary of the
congress, has admitted that the Communist Party contributed $100 a month to
its support.</p>

<p>From the record of its activities and the composition of its governing bodies
there can be little doubt that it has served as what James W. Ford, Communist
Vice Presidential candidate elected to the executive committee in 1937 predicted:
an important sector of the Democratic front sponsored and supported by the
Communist Party.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those are the words of Francis Biddle, Attorney General of the
United States, in 1942. Do you say that statement was not worthy of
consideration?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I, of course, didn’t have that statement in front
of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It would have been in front of you if you had inquired
about it. It was in the Congressional Record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. We didn’t take the Congressional Record. There
are many things in the Congressional Record, as you well know, that
you just don’t take as it’s the Bible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Actually you were not interested to see whether or
not the money which you were paying out was for the promotion of
Communist Party projects?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That didn’t enter into our consideration, the fact
that an organization came to us with a specific application for a specific
purpose to do a certain job, and if we thought it ought to be done and
thought it was in the provisions of the will we granted it. We didn’t
think it was incumbent upon the trustees to make any kind of an investigation
into these organizations as far as the political opinions
and beliefs of their leaders or their members, whatever they might be.
We just didn’t do it. It just wasn’t particularly being done by private
individuals or private trusts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did your foundation make grants totaling $1,500
to the Southern Conference for Human Welfare?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is, through 1942 and subsequently increased
to a grand total of $14,000.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_541">541</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am sure, I don’t know whether that total is correct,
but I am sure we made grants to the Southern Conference for
Human Welfare.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you look into that organization or the formation
of that organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. From my own information they were doing
an excellent job in the field of promoting Negro rights, in the field
of organizing of labor unions, and so on in the South, and particularly
asked for the grant, if I remember correctly, to employ a labor secretary
to develop that particular part of the conference or group.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. This organization was cited as Communist-front
which received money from the Robert Marshall Foundation, one of
the principal sources of funds by which many Communist-fronts
operate, Special Committee on Un-American Activities reported
March 29, 1944.</p>

<p>Did you make total grants of $30,750 to the Southern Negro Youth
Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am sure we made grants to the Southern Negro
Youth Congress. Whether that total is correct, I can’t say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. This organization was cited on December 4, 1947,
by Attorney General Tom Clark as subversive and among the affiliates
and committees of the Communist Party, U. S. A., which seeks to alter
the form of the Government of the United States by unconstitutional
means.</p>

<p>You thought that was not worth looking into?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew nothing about that. I certainly knew that
that was&mdash;Who said that? I don’t know who said it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Attorney General Tom Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Do you think yourself that&mdash;well, that Tom
Clark’s mere proscription of this organization is sufficient?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Certainly this should have been a warning to you
to make some inquiry and investigation unless your view and purpose
was to help the Communist Party by promoting its interests
through large awards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That might be your conclusion but there were
certainly no awards or grants made to these organizations from the
point of view of being beneficial in any respect to the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall grants having been made of $6,000 to
U. S. Week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I think I can recall that. Wasn’t that young
Bill Dodd (William E. Dodd, Jr.), son of the former Ambassador to
Germany?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Young Bill Dodd was the son of the former United
States Ambassador to Germany, but I don’t know who applied to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think that was the magazine he was interested
in, if I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It was cited on March 29, 1949, by this committee
as a Communist front which received funds from your Robert Marshall
Foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. When was the grant made to U. S. Week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. 1941. Were grants made to American Youth for
Democracy in the amount of $5,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Was it grants or grant?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_542">542</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not sure whether that is the total grant or
whether that is one grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am not, either. I recollect a considerable amount
of discussion about that grant when it came up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the nature of the discussion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. There was some discussion about what kind of a
job they were doing and what organization it was, and so on. I am
pretty sure the grant was not continued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It was cited as subversive and Communist by
Attorney General Tom Clark on December 4, 1947, and the citation
by the Special Committee on Un-American Activities report March 29,
1944, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cited as the new name under which the Young Communist League operates
and which also largely absorbed the American Youth Congress.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Do you know when the grant was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No; I do not. It would be between 1942 and 1951,
but I don’t know the specific date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can remember a discussion about the grant, and
I think you will find&mdash;I could be wrong, but I think there was only
one grant made, and it was discontinued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were grants totaling $6,500 made to the California
Labor School?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I don’t know whether that total amount is
correct, but I know a grant was made to the California Labor School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. This organization was cited by Attorney General
Tom Clark on June 1, 1948, as a subversive and Communist
organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Do you know when the grant was made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No, sir. Grants totaling $8,000 were made to the
Council for Pan-American Democracy. Do you recall those grants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can remember that a grant was made, or grants,
to that organization, but I can’t remember who the people were that
were involved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The organization was cited by Attorney General
Tom Clark on June 1, 1948, as subversive and Communist and by the
Special Committee on Un-American Activities report on March
29, 1944, and again on June 25, 1942.</p>

<p>$21,000 was granted to Farm Research, according to our information.
Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I don’t recall it, but I presume your information
is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Farm Research was cited by the Special Committee
on Un-American Activities on March 29, 1944, as a Communist-front
organization, receiving finances from the Robert Marshall
Foundation.</p>

<p>Did the foundation make grants to the National Lawyers Guild in
the amount of $15,250?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am sure it did, although I don’t know whether
the amount is correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the purpose of those grants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The purpose of those grants was to assist the
Lawyers Guild in getting out certain legal material as far as particular
labor cases before the NLRB and the courts were concerned.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_543">543</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it furnished to assist the guild in getting out
any other work besides that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. They came in with a specific application to
do this particular kind of job or work that had to be done, and
where they were working particularly in representation of labor, in
the labor field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Total of $25,000 was granted, according to our information,
to the New World?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. $25,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I know grants were made, I think that paper was
originally called the Washington New Dealer. Isn’t that right?
And grants were made to it while it was the Washington New Dealer.
It was changed to the New World and grants were made both to it
as the Washington New Dealer and the New World.</p>

<p>But the minute it became a part of the People’s World which became
a Northwest edition of the People’s World, there were no further
grants made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you procure from the Robert Marshall Foundation
a grant to be used by any progressive causes in the Northwest in
May 1949?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I think a grant for the Seattle Labor
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the amount of that $4,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You left Seattle in May 1949 to attend your meeting
in New York City of your trustees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. I don’t know whether it was May of 1949,
but some time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And returned with $4,000 for the Seattle Labor
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The Seattle Labor School, according to the testimony
of Barbara Hartle, is the same as the Pacific Northwest Labor
School. It was first known by the name of Seattle Labor School and
then later became known as the Pacific Northwest Labor School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Wasn’t it the other way around?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I may have it backward. You probably would
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t remember which was which, but I think it
was the other way around. But I can remember that grant; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who was instrumental in soliciting the funds for
that labor school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. John Daschbach.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The same person who used your name on the catalogue
of the school as an instructor of course 112?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You knew it was a Communist Party school at that
time, didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It was cited by the Attorney General Tom Clark,
as early as December 4, 1947.</p>

<p>You again state you just didn’t pay any attention to that citation
by an Attorney General?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_544">544</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t recall that it was cited. I don’t remember,
but as I said, a citation by the Attorney General or placing it on a
list would not be determinative for me as to whether or not it ought
to get a grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We have demonstrated in the testimony to you here
today that nearly every teacher on the staff was a member of the
Communist Party, according to testimony before this committee. We
have shown you now the citation of the Attorney General of that
school, and we find now that you procured this grant of $4,000.</p>

<p>Did you procure any other money for this school besides this grant
of $4,000?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I can’t&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Our information is that the total amount advanced
to the Pacific Northwest Labor School was $11,500.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I thought you meant money outside of the Marshall
Foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am pretty sure grants were made to the Seattle
Labor School for 2 or 3 years, I don’t remember which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In fact, it would have closed its doors but for the
financial assistance given it through you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As a matter of fact, when the last grant was made
it had closed its doors and the grant was made to pay up debts and
salaries and things of that kind that were&mdash;incurred loans.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Salaries to Communist Party teachers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. Daschbach’s salary for one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He has been identified by a number of witnesses
as an active member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as I was concerned, I didn’t know he was
a member of the Communist Party and many of these people I don’t
even know that you read today as teachers at that school, I don’t even
know.</p>

<p>I do know Gundlach, who was a professor at the University of
Washington. Whether he is a Communist or not, I don’t know,
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You are not willing to accept the testimony of a
Communist Party functionary, the No. 2 person in the Communist
Party in the State of Washington, for that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, of course, I haven’t had an opportunity to
read her testimony. Did she say Gundlach was a Communist? The
reason I feel so sure Gundlach isn’t a Communist is when the State
un-American activities committee was conducting its investigations
out there&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I read to you this morning and read into the record
the identification of Gundlach as a member of the Communist Party,
according to the testimony given this committee and my recollection
is that it was Barbara Hartle.</p>

<p>At any rate, didn’t you know that and weren’t you aware of the
fact that he was ousted from the university as a professor because of
his Communist Party membership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If I remember correctly, and it is a long time ago,
Gundlach was actually ousted, if I remember correctly, because President
Allen, who was at the university at the time, didn’t think he was
a Communist but thought that his conduct in connection with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_545">545</span>
investigation that was carried on by the State un-American activities
committee, was such that he didn’t think he was a fit and proper
person to be a teacher at the university. That is my recollection of it.</p>

<p>The reason I wonder about Gundlach is that he took an entirely
different course, as I remember, before the State un-American activities
committee out there than certain others who were there later, but
if Barbara Hartle says he is and says he was, she may be right. I
don’t know. All I am doing is conjecturing on the basis of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As a matter of fact, Mr. O’Connell, from your vast
experience and your intelligence, didn’t you form the opinion that the
Pacific Northwest Labor School was a training school for the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I particularly didn’t get that idea because I
know some excellent people who were connected with the school. One
is Frank Carlson, who was in the streetcarmen’s union out there who
was an outstanding labor leader who certainly wasn’t a Communist.</p>

<p>I. E. Sandvigen of the machinists union was not a Communist, I am
sure. Many others identified with the school particularly in the labor
movement that promoted the school and I think what may have happened
to it as it went along, I don’t know, but the idea of the school
was a good one and I think they were trying to do a good job.</p>

<p>Daschbach became director of the school somewhat later in its history,
as I remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me read into the record at this point, Mr. Chairman,
the testimony of Barbara Hartle regarding the labor school.
She was asked the question as to what connection there was between
the school and the Communist Party. That is between the Pacific
Northwest Labor School and the Communist Party. Her answer was
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Pacific Northwest Labor School was a Communist front project in the field
of education and its basic purpose was to spread Marxist-Leninist education, but
to do it in such a way as to attract non-Communists in addition to its use for
being a school for Communist Party members.</p>

<p>It had a double purpose, to educate the party membership and to draw as
many non-Communists into classes as possible at the same time. It was not
considered a party leadership training school, it was more for the membership.
And in order to attract a broader segment of persons into the school a
number of courses were included that were not in Marxism-Leninism, but they
were included in order to appeal to people from labor unions, professional fields,
and others.</p>

<p>For example, parliamentary law would be a subject intended for the purpose
of drawing people into the school and drawing them closer to it with no idea on
their part that they were getting into a Communist school. An air of respectability
was also created in this way so that people would feel if they enrolled in this
school they had a perfect right to do so and there was nothing wrong with being
in it.</p>

<p>The hope, of course, was that if non-Communists enrolled this way, after a while
they would learn more about it and would become convinced to enroll in courses
on Marxist-Leninism. The objective of the school was to gain Communist influence
over non-Communists, recruit as many people as possible out of this
school into the Communist Party, and special attention was paid to members of
organized labor through this school.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Doyle</span>. The committee will stand in recess until 9:30 tomorrow
morning.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 4:20 p. m. the committee was recessed, to reconvene
at 9:30 a. m., Thursday, June 2, 1955.)

<h5>PUBLIC HEARING</h5>

<p>A subcommittee met, pursuant to recess, at 9:45 a. m. in the Caucus
Room, Old House Office Building, Hon. Edwin E. Willis, presiding.</p>

<p>Committee members present: Representatives Edwin E. Willis and
Gordon H. Scherer.</p>

<p>Staff members present: Frank S. Tavenner, counsel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The subcommittee will come to order.</p>

<p>Let the record show there are present today Mr. Scherer, of Ohio,
and myself, Edwin E. Willis, of Louisiana.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the subcommittee is reconstituted, that is, members
are here today who were not present yesterday, it might be well to
reswear the witness.</p>

<p>Let the record show also that the chairman of the committee appointed

<p>Will you stand and be sworn? Do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you are about to give before this subcommittee will be the

<h3 id="TESTIMONY_OF_JEREMIAH_JOSEPH_O_CONNEL_RESUMED">TESTIMONY OF JEREMIAH JOSEPH O’CONNELL&mdash;Resumed</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, continuing with the matter of grants
by the Robert Marshall Foundation, of which you were one of the
trustees, it is noted that grants totaling $30,366.85 were made to you.
Can you explain that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. Those would be in my opinion the total
amount that I received for traveling expenses, for meetings of the
foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you mean, then, no specific grant was actually
made to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. There was no actual specific grant made to me.
The provisions of the will, as I remember them, provided that the
trustees are to receive no compensation except their traveling expenses
to and from meetings of the trustees of the foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I note that there was introduced into the record
during the Canwell hearings, check No. 94 bearing date of October 2,
1942, drawn on the funds of the Robert Marshall Foundation in the
amount of $150 made payable to you.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_548">548</span></p>

<p>Have you any explanation to make of that item?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am sure that, if I knew the meeting date of the
foundation at that time, we also had a practice when a meeting of the
foundation was called by the trustees, if the financial situation of the
trustee involved was such that he needed an advance for expenses to
come to the meeting, an advance was made in the amount of probably
$150 or so, but it was always expended for either transportation or
meals and hotel and so on, while in attendance at the meetings of the
foundation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You testified yesterday that in May of 1949 you
procured a grant of $4,000 for the use of the Northwest Pacific Labor
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Of course I think that ought to be&mdash;I personally
couldn’t procure the grant. The grant was voted by at least a majority
of the trustees for the Pacific Northwest Labor School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the grant actually made through your efforts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I advocated that the grant be made, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And Daschbach interviewed you with regard to it
before you presented it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was any part of that grant or any other grant used
for the benefit of the Northwest edition of the Daily People’s World?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as I know, certainly not. I mean the grants
were made to the organization and certainly no part of that grant
as far as I would know, what actually Daschbach may have done with
it later I wouldn’t be able to specifically say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you learn anything about it, even from a second-hand
source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I never learned, never had any information
that it was used for any other purpose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you know whether any part of the $4,000 grant
or any other grant from the foundation was used for the benefit of
the Civil Rights Congress in the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know whether it was, that grant or any
other grant. I know there was some argument and some consultation
with me by Mr. Daschbach about it and I was very specific&mdash;I
think that was before the grant was made&mdash;and I was very specific
with him that no part of the grant would be used for any other purpose
than that for which it was made. That was the Pacific Northwest
Labor School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was John Daschbach an official of the Civil Rights
Congress in Seattle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If I remember correctly, I left Seattle, I don’t remember
when the Civil Rights Congress was organized in Seattle,
but as I remember when I left Seattle Daschbach was then functioning
as head or director of the Washington Civil Rights Congress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did he hold that position at the time he spoke to
you about the use of proceeds of the grant for the Civil Rights Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t think I would be able to say whether he
was actually in the position at that time. I can’t recall. I remember
at the time that he asked me about the grant they were closing out,
they were terminating this Seattle Labor School and they had borrowed
money from particularly various labor union members about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_549">549</span>
the town. I remember I think it was either Frank or Fred Carlson
to whom they owed money and other people, I can’t remember precisely
who they were now, but anyway the representations made to
me in connection with the grant were they were trying to close out
the labor school and pay off their debts and pay I think back salaries
that were owed to Mr. Daschbach and to some others there, I don’t
know who.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was John Daschbach known to you to be a member
of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I never knew John Daschbach was a member of
the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Had you heard that he was a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I had never heard that he was a member of the
Communist Party. I actually, my first, I think the first time I met
Mr. Daschbach was in Spokane and I think he was attending Gonzaga
University, a Jesuit university in Spokane, and as far as I knew personally,
I didn’t know he was a Communist, didn’t know whether he
was or was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You are aware now, are you not, that he has been
identified by a number of witnesses as a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I couldn’t say that I know that precisely; but I
do know he was indicted as a Smith Act defendant in Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And convicted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. And convicted. I don’t know whether he is
in prison now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall what individual it was in the National
Lawyers Guild who solicited an award from the trustees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, my best recollection as far as that would be
concerned is that it was Mr. Martin Popper, who was an attorney
in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the executive secretary of the National Lawyers
Guild take any part in representations or solicitations regarding the
grant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think Mr. Silberstein (Robert J. Silberstein), I
wouldn’t remember correctly. It is hard for me to remember. I
would say Mr. Silberstein actually probably prepared the actual
application that was made to the foundation for a grant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did he confer with you about the matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can never even remember Bob Silberstein talking
to me about a grant for the Lawyers Guild. As I remember the
particular grant, it was made in connection with labor work that the
guild was doing, and Mr. Martin Popper, as I remember it, was the
one who actually made the presentation, at least I know he talked to
me and I think to some of the other trustees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The New World issue of March 25, 1948, reflects
that Jerry O’Connell launched a series of three special forum programs
at the Pacific Northwest Labor School to discuss our foreign
policy and our fight for peace. Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I don’t recall that. I know I never made any
speeches at Seattle Labor School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you have any connection with the presentation
of a special forum program at the Seattle Labor School?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_550">550</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I certainly cannot recall any. I don’t remember
ever speaking at the Seattle Labor School or being involved in any
forum. Was that a forum I was supposed to conduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The article says you launched a series of three
forum programs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It says it is on foreign policy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That the subject was Our Foreign Policy and Our
Fight for Peace.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I certainly don’t remember any such thing. Practically
all the time I was in the State of Washington I was engaged
either as executive secretary of the Democratic Party or was executive
secretary of the Progressive Party and my particular work was
in political organization and political work and I don’t want to say I
did or didn’t but I certainly now don’t recall any such series of lectures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, you have advised us that you became
chairman of the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill during
the year 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you aware of a special fund drive conducted
by the Communist Party in 1947 for the purpose of fighting anticipated
congressional action relating to the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I had no knowledge of any such&mdash;what was it a
fund?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mrs. Blauvelt testified before the Committee on Un-American
Activities within the past 3 weeks on that subject. She was
a police detective for the city of New York and was a member of the
Communist Party and served the New York City Police Department
as an underground agent for a period of more than 8 years before her
identity was discovered. Mrs. Blauvelt testified for nearly a week.</p>

<p>In the course of this testimony she stated that upon the agitation for
a bill relating to communism in the House of Representatives the
Communist Party hurriedly made a fund drive and that they sought
to raise a total of $225,000 for the purpose of fighting the opposition
to communism. Within 25 days the Communist Party raised $250,000.</p>

<p>During the period that you were chairman of this committee to defeat
the Mundt bill&mdash;that was over the period from 1948 until some
time in 1950 or 1951&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; but it ought to be explained that in 1948 the
only functioning of the committee was from a period I would say
probably in June of 1948 until the adjournment of Congress, which
was in that year I think, because of the party conventions, the national
conventions, was adjourned quite early.</p>

<p>I know there was probably, I was here probably a month or a little
over a month in that connection, and then I did not&mdash;all during 1949
there was no functioning of the committee whatsoever, as I remember
it, and I think the first time I came down in 1950 was, I would say,
about March of 1950 and I was here until about maybe the early
part of June, when I returned to Montana to take the bar exams I
have already talked about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As you stated, you came back here in July and were
here for a period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think the latter part of July or first part of
August and I was here until the Congress adjourned sine die about
the middle of September.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_551">551</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>To complete my question: Did the Communist Party give your committee
any financial assistance at any time during the period from
1948 to 1950 while you were chairman of the National Committee To
Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Of my knowledge, I don’t know of any assistance
that the Communist Party gave to the National Committee To Defeat
the Mundt Bill. I, of course received, all I received, I think I received
$125 a week salary, if I remember correctly. I had no charge of
funds or the expenditure of funds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was that salary of $125 a week paid by the Progressive
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In 1948 I think the salary was paid by the Progressive
Party, but I am not too sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you not so certify on the reports made to the
Clerk of the House of Representatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If I did, that was so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. For the record, Mr. Tavenner, state the substance of
the Mundt bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The Mundt bill is that section of the Internal
Security Act of 1950 which requires the registration of the Communist
Party and registration of Communist fronts. There is also
written into that bill the substance of what was known as the Wood
bill, which dealt with persons employed in defense contracts. The
remaining part of the bill related to immigration and naturalization
matters and is known as a different section of the bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Then I think there was the detention camp features
added in the Senate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. There are no detention camp features to the bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In the bill that was finally passed in the Senate
I think Senator Kilgore and some of the other Democratic Senators
offered an amendment to the bill or a provision that provided for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In conference between the Representatives of the
Senate and the House, it was agreed to accept the House bill exactly
as prepared and submitted by this committee, which was done.</p>

<p>How were you employed at the time you first became chairman of
this committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was the executive secretary of the Progressive
Party in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I believe you have told us that Mr. Robert J. Silberstein,
executive secretary of the National Lawyers Guild, was one of the
official family of the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My recollection is he was secretary. I don’t want
to be held to it but I am pretty sure he was the secretary of the committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he a person known to you to be a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I never knew Bob Silberstein to be a member
of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I didn’t get the last answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I never knew or did not know that Bob Silberstein
was a member of the Communist Party and I don’t know it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Had you heard he was a member of the Communist
Party?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_552">552</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I had not heard that he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Up until this present time you have not heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I have not heard that Bob Silberstein is a member
of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, this committee heard 2 witnesses
from California in 1952, both of them attorneys at law, one of them a
professor at a law university, who testified to the effect that Mr.
Silberstein was a member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Silberstein was subpenaed before this committee and confronted
with the testimony of those two lawyers and he refused to testify on
the subject, claiming that to do so might tend to incriminate him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Just for the record, Mr. Tavenner, I, of course,
haven’t read all the proceedings of this committee; I have not had
available to me the transcript of the hearings of the committee, what
some lawyers in California may have testified about Bob Silberstein
in 1952, I don’t know anything about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you aware of the fact that the National Lawyers
Guild has been cited by this committee as a Communist-front
organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you a member of the National Lawyers Guild?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am a member, have been and am now a member
of the National Lawyers Guild.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. When did you last have any connection with Robert
J. Silberstein?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In 1950, sir. In 1950 we had occasional meetings
in connection with the Mundt bill at that time and Mr. Silberstein
attended those meetings and I am pretty sure he was the secretary of
the organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Was that the last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is the last time I have seen Bob Silberstein.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Have you had any communication with him since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I of course receive a membership card in the National
Lawyers Guild and I think it is signed by Bob Silberstein as
executive secretary, or executive secretary of the National Lawyers
Guild.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Is that his position today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My understanding is he has resigned, at the last
convention of the National Lawyers Guild, that he resigned and was
replaced by somebody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do you know what he is doing today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I don’t have any idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do you know where he lives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, the last I knew he was living in New York.
He actually, I think, comes from New Jersey and I think he is married
to a banker’s daughter who comes from wealthy family, if I
remember correctly, in New Jersey.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee the circumstances under
which the Progressive Party contributed your services to the National
Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, in connection with the&mdash;there were hearings
being held in the Senate, as I stated yesterday, by a subcommittee of
the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1948. I think those hearings were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_553">553</span>
being presided over by former Senator Ferguson and Senator Langer
of North Dakota was a member of the committee.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, we received a communication from the
national office of the Progressive Party, I think particularly from Mr.
C. B. Baldwin, who was then executive vice chairman, if I remember
rightly, asking us to send, the Progressive Party of the State of Washington,
to send somebody to Washington to testify at this hearing before
the Senate Judiciary subcommittee, and I was delegated by the
Progressive Party in the State of Washington to come to testify at
that hearing. I also think Mr. Russell Fluent, who was chairman of
the Progressive Party at that time&mdash;he was also incumbent Democratic
State treasurer of the State of Washington, was also a delegate, and
I think the two of us came down here to testify and I said yesterday
while we were waiting to testify the hearings had been going on
several days, Senator Ferguson adjourned the hearings and Senator
Langer&mdash;a considerable number of the people there were upset because
they had waited around to be heard and there was considerable protestation,
as I remember, about the hearings being adjourned and so
Senator Langer asked the people who had not testified to come to his
office or, rather, his committee room.</p>

<p>As I remember then he was chairman of the Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads of the Senate, and we adjourned to that particular
committee room and had a meeting there. I can’t remember
now the precise details of the situation, whether it was Senator Langer
or somebody in the group or who it was who suggested a committee
ought to be formed to defeat the bill. I know Senator Langer suggested
I become chairman of the committee. He had known me as
a member of Congress and I have known him for a long time. North
Dakota and Montana are very close together and our political situations
are quite similar and so on.</p>

<p>So it was at that meeting it was decided I should become chairman,
that I should stay to see what could be done to lobby and so forth, to
see what could be done to defeat the legislation. I think arrangements
were then made with the Progressive Party in the State of
Washington for me to stay down here during the month or so that was
necessary and to have my salary advanced by the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was the occasion for your return to Washington
in March of 1950?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I remember, the legislation had again been
reintroduced. It had not cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in
1948 by the time of congressional adjournment, then, but I think the
legislation was reintroduced in the next session of Congress and if I
remember correctly it passed, it had already passed the House and
it was pending in the Senate, and hearings were being held and were
to be held in the Senate in March of 1950.</p>

<p>I came on down. I don’t remember whether, I can’t remember
whether it was Mr. Silberstein or Mr. Waybur (Bruce Waybur), who
contacted me and it was anticipated at the time I would have to spend
about a month down there lobbying.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I hand you a copy of a telegram which the committee
procured under subpena duces tecum from the Western Union,
dated July 18, 1950, addressed to you, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Greetings. Essential you take first plane or train here.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_554">554</span></p></blockquote>

<p>It shows it was charged to the National Lawyers Guild and signed
“Silberstein.” The telegram was charged to the National Lawyers
Guild. Will you examine it, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir. I think that is the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire to offer the telegram in evidence and ask
that it be marked “O’Connell Exhibit No. 2” for identification purposes
only and to be made a part of the committee files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. It is so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What is the date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. July 18, 1950.</p>

<p>Did you then advise Mr. Silberstein that you would require advancement
of funds for the purpose of making the trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I remember, I had been down here, as I said
earlier, from March until I returned to Montana to take the bar examinations,
and then I was out there in the State of Montana getting
ready to establish my law practice and I got this wire from Mr. Silberstein
to come back, or to come on down. Now what arrangements
were made to send me funds, I don’t know whether Mr. Silberstein&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I hand you a second telegram addressed to you
under date of July 26, 1950, signed “Silberstein,” and charged to the
account of the National Lawyers Guild, and obtained by this committee
in the same manner as the former telegram, reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sorry funds not available here. Proceed other plans.</p></blockquote>

<p>Does that refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What this would mean, as far as I can recollect
now, was that of course I informed him I had no funds to come down
here, to fly or whatever it was, and that unless I had them I would not
be able to come and would stay out in the State of Montana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was meant by that part of the telegram which
suggested that you “proceed other plans?”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The thing, I am sure I can’t remember now but I am
sure I told Mr. Silberstein that I had no funds of my own to advance
to come down to Washington and do any kind of work down here, and
that unless I got funds I would not be able to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That explanation would not be responsive to the
language of the telegram. The telegram says “proceed other plans.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It says, “Proceed other plans.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. “Proceed other plans.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What other plans?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as I was concerned, I am sure I had notified
them unless there were funds sent to me I could not come down here
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Would it be logical that Mr. Silberstein would tell
you to proceed by other plans, when to adopt your construction it
would mean that that just meant for you to remain where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, actually, I imagine if I had all of the correspondence
or wires here I could probably give you the full and
complete story. That is way back, almost 5 years ago. It is hard
for me to recall but I am pretty sure that what I told him if I didn’t
have the funds, whatever work I would have to do on the bill it would
have to be done from the State of Montana.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_555">555</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire to offer the document in evidence, and
asked that it be marked “O’Connell Exhibit 3,” for identification purposes
only, and be made a part of the committee files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. It is so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. On July 28, 1950, 2 days later, there was another
telegram signed “Silberstein” directed to you and charged to the National
Lawyers Guild, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Means now available for travel. Telephone me collect.</p></blockquote>

<p>Will you examine that telegram, please, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What is the date on the second one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. 26th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think this would be in line with what I had said.
I told him there was no way I could possibly come without funds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire to offer the document in evidence and ask
that it be marked “O’Connell Exhibit No. 4” for identification purposes
only, and to be made a part of the committee files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. It is so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How were the funds referred to in Silberstein’s
telegram made available to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I just don’t remember, but I am pretty sure that
Mr. Silberstein sent me the funds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were those funds, funds of the National Lawyers
Guild?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really couldn’t say whether they were the funds
of the National Lawyers Guild or not. As I remember, there was some
confusion between the guild and Mr. Waybur of the national committee
about the funds. I think Silberstein sent these wires out of the
National Lawyers Guild office and then, if I remember, later collected
from the national committee for them, the National Committee to
Defeat the Mundt Bill.</p>

<p>But as I remember, my best recollection is I got the funds from Mr.
Silberstein. I have a recollection, they could have been Lawyers Guild
funds or could have been Mr. Silberstein’s personal check, I am not
sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When you returned to Washington did you establish
a headquarters for the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt
Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If I remember correctly, Mr. Silberstein was
taking his vacation at that time. I think a month or 6 weeks’ vacation.
He turned over to us the use of the field offices here in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The National Lawyers Guild offices in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What address was that? Do you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The thing that comes to my mind was 918 or 920
K Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Wasn’t it 902 20th Street NW.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I think that is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As a matter of fact, hadn’t that been the headquarters
since 1948 of the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt
Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. Originally we set up offices in a building
downtown on&mdash;what is the main street? Is it E Street, where the
theaters are all located?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_556">556</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Could that be F Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. F Street. I guess it is. If I remember correctly,
the building is the Atlantic Building or some such name, and we had
offices there during 1948, and early&mdash;I know offices before I returned
to Montana were also in the same building in 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When did you first occupy the offices of the National
Lawyers Guild as the headquarters of the National Committee
To Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am sure when I came back after July 28, I probably
got there&mdash;I can’t remember&mdash;either the very last part of July
or the early part of August.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Now, prior to 1950 had you registered as a lobbyist
for the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill with the Clerk
of the House of Representatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did anyone else register with you for the same
purpose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I couldn’t say for sure, but I think Mr. Waybur
did. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me refresh your recollection. Our investigation
shows Mr. John B. Stone registered with you on the same day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I remember he was doing press work, press
relations for the committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who selected Mr. Stone to register?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Who selected him to register?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I imagine we had a discussion in the office and
decided that whoever was involved would have to register with the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You had a discussion? You and who else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Myself, Mr. Silberstein, Mr. Waybur, Mr. Stone,
and at different times some of the other people who are listed on the
committee stationery there. I can’t remember just which one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was Mr. Stone known to you to be a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; he was not. His father had been the dean of
the school of journalism out at the University of Montana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Does that mean the son can’t be an active member
of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t want to argue with you, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Why present that as a reason?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wanted to tell you how I knew Mr. Stone and
how I happened to know him. He, of course, was a Montanan, and I
knew him that way, and I knew him when I was in Congress. I think
he was in the press gallery when I was in Congress for the Federated
Press, if I remember correctly, but I certainly had no knowledge that
Mr. Stone was a member of the Communist Party and have no such
knowledge, even at this moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think the record should show
at this point Mrs. Mary Stalcup Markward at the instance of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation entered the Communist Party in the
city of Washington and served there in an undercover capacity and
by reason of her diligence in her work she was elevated finally to the
position of treasurer of the Communist Party for the District of
Columbia.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_557">557</span></p>

<p>She appeared before this committee and testified and among other
things identified members of the newspaper club of the Communist
Party in the District of Columbia. Of those persons identified as
members of that club she named John B. Stone, and when asked
to give the committee her knowledge of his activities stated that he
had been active within the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt
Bill, and stated that, “I know Rob Hall suggested him for membership
due to his activity with the Progressive Party.”</p>

<p>Was Mr. Stone active in the Progressive Party in Montana, when
you knew him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Of course the Progressive Party&mdash;Mr. Stone was
in Montana in the late twenties and early thirties and so on, when he
might have been identified with the old Progressive Party of Bob
La Follette and Senator Wheeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he active in the Progressive Party in the
District of Columbia?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I want to ask the witness the same questions I did
about Silberstein. When did you last see Stone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think the last time I saw Stone was in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That was here in Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. In connection with what activities?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Doing press work for the National Committee to
Defeat the Mundt Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Is that the last contact you had with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. I had no&mdash;that was the last contact and the
only contact I have had with him outside of the fact that when he
lived out in Montana and because of my political activity and prominence
out there, I knew him at that time.</p>

<p>I was just wondering when he became&mdash;when Rob Hall nominated
him for membership or whatever he did&mdash;does she date that any
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Her membership in the party was from 1943 to
1949, so it would be within the limits of that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I got the impression from what you said that he
was recommended because of the work he had done in the National
Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No; I may not have stated that clearly. I would
like to restate it.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Markward was asked as to her knowledge of Stone’s
activities within the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill,
she testified: “I know Robert Hall suggested him for membership”&mdash;that
meant membership in the Communist Party&mdash;“due to his activity
with the Progressive Party.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The Progressive Party wasn’t organized until
1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That would indicate that it must then have been
about 1948 or 1949 when this occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My distinct feeling&mdash;I don’t know what he may
have done, but my distinct feeling about Mr. Stone is he was not a
member of the Communist Party as long as I knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do you know what Stone is doing today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I really don’t.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_558">558</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. The last contact you had with him then was, as you
said, 1949?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I would say, I think the last contact I had with
him was in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do you know what his activities were following 1948?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I really don’t. I haven’t kept up with him.
I think&mdash;well, I know at the time he was writing some stories, children’s
stories, or something of that kind. He was talking about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you select Stone as the publicity man for the
National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I probably had more to do with his selection than
anybody because of course I knew him as a newspaperman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How many persons normally composed the staff of
the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Actually in 1948 the only ones outside of Mr. Silberstein,
Mr. Waybur, and one or two of those people on the letterhead,
if they were in town and would come to the meeting, the actual people
working in the office were Mr. Stone and myself and a stenographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you have more than one stenographer at a time,
usually?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think when the situation, as far as the legislation
was concerned, was critical we may have had additional stenographers
to help get out additional material.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was Rose Clinton ever a member of your staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Not to my knowledge. I don’t know anybody by
the name of “Rose Clinton.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The quarterly statement submitted by you for the
period ended June 30, 1949, filed July 9, 1949, reveals that she was
employed by your committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If she were, I certainly don’t recollect or remember
her. She was probably an ordinary stenographer. Her name
means&mdash;I have no recollection, and it means nothing to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Have you any recollection of her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I can’t, I think&mdash;does it show she was a stenographer
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes; shows she was paid a salary of $250 for the
month of June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t remember. There could have been. I
remember one little girl there and the name I remember is Marjorie.
I think her first name was Marjorie. I don’t know if that was in the
1948 period or the 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think the record should also show
that according to the testimony of Mrs. Mary Markward, Rose Clinton
was known to her as a member of the Communist Party in the District
of Columbia and assigned to the Northeast Club of the Communist
Party in this city.</p>

<p>In the course of her testimony Mrs. Markward said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rose Clinton, I believe she was active in the Committee To Defeat the Mundt
Bill in 1949.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wasn’t in the city of Washington in 1949 in connection
with the National Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. However, were you not chairman for the National
Committee to Defeat the Mundt Bill during that period?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_559">559</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You signed quarterly reports showing who were
employed and the amounts of salaries paid?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am pretty sure the reports were sent to me in
Montana in 1949, and I signed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you acquainted with a person named Tom
Buchanan?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think he did the presswork for the committee
in 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you employ him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. When I came down here in 1950 he had
already been employed by Mr. Waybur or Mr. Silberstein; I don’t
know which. I think, wasn’t he a reporter, had been a reporter for
the Washington Star?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes; he was until he was removed from that position.
Did you know Tom Buchanan to be a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think the record should also show
that Tom Buchanan was identified in the testimony of Mrs. Mary
Stalcup Markward as an ex-Washington newspaperman assigned to
the Youth Club of the Communist Party when he became a member
of the Communist Party in Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Later he was transferred to the Newspaper Club of the Communist
Party in Washington and since that time has been an employee of the
Civil Rights Congress in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Does it state when he became a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not certain that it does. I do not have her
testimony with me. But I am not certain as to the number of years
of Communist Party membership before he was assigned to the Newspaper
Club of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Was Ruth Rifkin an employee of your committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t remember now. The name doesn’t&mdash;wasn’t
she a notary public?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. She could have been a notary public.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Didn’t she run in addition to being a notary public,
didn’t she run a mimeograph shop or something of that kind? That
is the recollection that I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. According to your report covering the period of
April 1950 she was employed in a secretarial capacity. She was paid
for secretarial services.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think she ran a secretarial service shop and did
mimeographing and so on. That is my recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How was she employed by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think we took particular materials to her sometimes
to dictate and then to have her run off on mimeograph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was she known to you to be a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, she was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like for the record to show
Mary Stalcup Markward in the course of her testimony before this
committee also identified Ruth Rifkin as a member of the Communist
Party.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_560">560</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Was she assigned or had anything to do with the
Newspaper Club of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No, sir. I am certain she was not, but I would like
to turn to that testimony, if I can locate it. I think it important to
read that testimony, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I asked that question because the witness identified
her as some kind of a secretarial service or mimeographing service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My only recollection about her was that her shop
was close to the Lawyers Guild office there and she did secretarial
work and got out mimeographing and my connection with her was
of course completely mechanical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who selected her for the performance of their
work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I would imagine Mr. Silberstein told me she did
that kind of work and where her office was and where her shop was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you acquainted with Elizabeth Sasuly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was she employed by the National Committee To
Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am pretty sure she was. I think she was employed
both in&mdash;well, I couldn’t say whether she was employed both
in 1948 and 1950 or just in 1948, or just in 1950, but my recollection
is she was employed both of the times I was down here in 1948 and in
1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was she known to you to be a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I had no knowledge that she was a member of
the Communist Party or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I think the record should show Elizabeth Sasuly
appeared before this committee on July 12, 1949, at which time she
refused to answer any and all questions put to her by the committee
pertaining to her membership in the Communist Party or any questions
relating to Communist Party activities in the city of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. In light of that I think it is important for the witness
to try to refresh his memory as to whether she was in fact employed
on his return to Washington in 1950 or do the payroll records so
indicate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Of course, Congressman, also I had no knowledge
she was before the committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I am not implying it. I want to be fair with you.
You are a lawyer and you can see the point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Possibly I can clear that up from reference to the
records. The report covering the second quarter of 1950 by you to the
House of Representatives shows that in April 1950 Elizabeth Sasuly
was paid salary and expenses of $359.89. Does that refresh your
recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. My recollection, I knew she was employed
by the committee, but I wasn’t sure which year, whether it was in 1948
or 1950 or whether it was both of those years, as a matter of fact. But, I
again, I repeat that I had no knowledge that she was or was not a
member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Returning now to Ruth Rifkin&mdash;&mdash;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_561">561</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If I remember correctly, was Miss Sasuly cited for
contempt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mrs. Markward was asked the question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Are you acquainted with an individual by the name of Ruth Rifkin?</p></blockquote>

<p>To which she replied: “Yes.”</p>

<p>She was asked the question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What was the nature of your relationship with Ruth Rifkin?</p></blockquote>

<p>And Mrs. Markward testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I got a transfer card from this individual together with a note saying if I
contact her I was to say I was Evelyn’s cousin. I believe she was living at McLean
Gardens at that time. I called and made an appointment to meet her. She was
quite cautious about the way this meeting should take place. We met at Union
Station and had dinner later. I learned later she was working for the United
Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration.</p>

<p>“Question. Where did she come from?</p>

<p>“Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markward</span>. New York.</p>

<p>“Question. What was the purpose of your contacting her?</p>

<p>“Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markward</span>. I contacted her as Evelyn’s cousin.</p>

<p>“Question. Did you pick her up on your rolls?</p>

<p>“Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markward</span>. Because of her working with the UNRRA in the State Department,
I could not transfer her in our organization as such. However, I
talked to her. She seemed extremely capable and a good Communist. So I
spoke to Elizabeth Searle about seeing if she could be picked up by some organization
that did take members working for the Government and Elizabeth Searle took
the address and how to get in touch with her and said she would see what could
be done.</p>

<p>“Question. Did you subsequently see Ruth Rifkin?</p>

<p>“Mrs. <span class="smcap">Markward</span>. Yes. She seemed disturbed by the manner in which she
had been contacted and she asked if this other person was all right. I went to
Elizabeth Searle about this and she said it was all right because this other person
was in a position that it would be assumed she was calling about union business.
Ruth Rifkin and I had dinner together at the time we had this conversation.
Ruth Rifkin told me she was not in a position with UNRRA that she wanted to
seem identified with a union. Elizabeth Searle told me to tell her not to call and
talk to me over the telephone, so I had no further contact with her.”</p></blockquote>

<p>That is the testimony relating to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Now I want to clarify&mdash;was she with UNRRA?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. According to the testimony of Mrs. Markward she
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In the State Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think UNRRA had been, I think it had actually
been discontinued by 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Suppose it was discontinued.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What I want to point out is that my relationship
with her is I brought her material to transcribe or to mimeograph and
so on. My recollection is she was running a secretarial shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Which of course was a period after UNRRA had
been disbanded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What I wanted to make clear is I had no connection
with her while she was a Government employee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, where did the committee have its
printing done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really couldn’t recollect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it the Superior Print Shop?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_562">562</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am sure we have it in the report there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Your report so says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who was the owner of the Superior Print Shop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Who made the arrangements for the Superior Print
Shop to do the printing for your committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I just couldn’t recollect who actually did it. I
would imagine the stenographer in the office called them to come and
said we had certain printing to do or something of that kind. I
wasn’t acquainted, I wasn’t in Washington, D. C., with the various
printing houses and my actual work with the committee was largely
on the Hill. I was rarely in the office. I was out here contacting
Members of the House and Members of the Senate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mrs. Markward in her testimony advised the committee
that the operator of the Superior Print Shop was Tilla Minowitz,
and she identified Tilla Minowitz as a member of the Communist
Party and as a member of the Community Club of the Communist
Party in Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Tilla Minowitz was subpenaed before this committee on July 6,
1949, and refused to answer any and all questions put to her by the
committee dealing with her membership in the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. July 6, 1949. The report covering June 1949 shows
the payment of a bill for printing in the amount of $195 and the report
covering March 1950 shows the printing of letterheads and stationery
on March 30, 1950.</p>

<p>Were you aware at that time that Tilla Minowitz had been identified
and had been brought before this committee and questioned regarding
her Communist Party identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I don’t know Tilla Minowitz, I don’t think
I have ever seen her in my life and the name means absolutely nothing
to me. The printing went to Superior Printing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You knew she was doing the printing for your
company because you signed these reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I didn’t know it was Tilla Minowitz. I knew it
was the Superior Printing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did your committee ever employ the firm of Presentation,
Inc.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Presentation, Inc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t recall. If I could see the report&mdash;What does
Presentation, Inc., do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We find a report covering June 22, 1949, which
says&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Presentation, Inc., 2118 Massachusetts Avenue NW., 25,000 pamphlets, $785.46&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>as one of the items. Does that help you to refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I said before, in 1949 I was not down in
Washington. Those reports were sent out to me to be signed as chairman,
and I don’t know Presentation, Inc. I don’t know what they
do, but that report was made up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Another bill in June and September of 1949 is for
printing, done by Presentation, Inc., and the amount of the bill is
$1,075.38. Who selected Presentation, Inc., for this work?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_563">563</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really wouldn’t know. I don’t know who did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Notwithstanding your having signed the reports
covering those employments in 1949 when you say you were not
actually in Washington, we find in April of 1950 another printing
of pamphlets on the Mundt bill was done by Presentation, Inc., for
which there was a charge of $300.</p>

<p>At that time did you know that a person by the name of Carl
Marzani, an official of that corporation, was under sentence of the
United States district court after having been convicted for concealing
his Communist Party affiliations while an employee of the
Federal Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I didn’t know that. In fact, I didn’t know
Presentation, Inc., and didn’t know anybody who was identified
with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, is it not a fact that during the
period that the Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill used the offices
of the National Lawyers Guild, it also used the National Lawyers
Guild telephone, bearing number District 3205, to which both telegrams
and telephone tolls were charged to the National Lawyers
Guild?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; but with an understanding, as I remember,
that whatever expenditure was made on the telephone or telegraph
was to be paid by the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you reimburse the National Lawyers Guild in
full?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really don’t know. I went home directly after
the adjournment of Congress in September of 1950 and what disposition
was made after I left of those bills and so on by Mr. Waybur,
I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You say you don’t know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. As I said, my principal work
was always up here on the Hill. I usually came up in the mornings
about 10 o’clock or 9:30 or so and was up here until either adjournment
of Congress or later, and so on, each day that I was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did Lillian Clott perform any services for the National
Lawyers Guild while you occupied its offices as chairman for
the committee to defeat the Mundt bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t recall. I know Lillian Clott and all that,
but I can’t recall whether she did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What were the circumstances under which you became
acquainted with Lillian Clott?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I remember, first of all her husband or ex-husband,
Herman Clott, is I think legislative representative here for
the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers and I
knew him and I think through him I was introduced to her. I think
she later worked, if I remember correctly, with the United Electrical
Workers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes; and prior to that time didn’t she work in one
of the Embassies here in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. I wouldn’t know whether she did
or not. When I came here Mr. Waybur, of course, was identified with,
I think he was legislative representative from the United Electrical
Workers and I went there lots of times to pick up my check and she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_564">564</span>
was working in the office there, and I think Senator Wheeler’s daughter
was also working there, Frances Wheeler, and she introduced me
to her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did she do any work at any time for the National
Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t remember that she did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was Lillian Clott known to you to be a member of
the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I didn’t know that she was or was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I think the record should show that
Mary Stalcup Markward in the course of her testimony identified
Lillian Clott as a member of the Community Club of the Communist
Party in the District of Columbia, and that when called as a witness
before this committee in September 1954, in Dayton, Ohio, Lillian
Clott refused to testify regarding her alleged Communist Party membership
on the ground that to do so might tend to incriminate her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Let’s take an informal recess.</p>

<p>(Brief recess.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The committee will come to order.</p>

<p>You may proceed, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, are you familiar with the testimony
of Matthew Cvetic before this committee, relating to the activities of
the Communist Party in the western part of Pennsylvania in connection
with the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I am not acquainted with that testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Matthew Cvetic became a member of the Communist
Party at the request of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
and after working quite a number of years for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation within the Communist Party, withdrew and testified
fully before this committee regarding his experience within the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. Cvetic testified that the District Committee of the Communist
Party of western Pennsylvania established a branch or a unit of the
National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill. This branch or unit
occupied no office of its own but worked out of the offices of the
Communist Party of western Pennsylvania in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Mr. Cvetic further testified that petitions and pamphlets published
by the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill were made available
in Pittsburgh for distribution by Communist Party headquarters.
He personally participated in the distribution of petitions and
pamphlets published by the National Committee To Defeat the Mundt
Bill at the instruction of the Communist Party functionaries in Pittsburgh.</p>

<p>Mr. Cvetic also testified that the officials of the Communist Party in
western Pennsylvania referred to the National Committee To Defeat
the Mundt Bill as “One of our organizations.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cvetic revealed that the strategy and planning of the fight
against the Mundt-Nixon bill in Pittsburgh was headed by the district
organizer of the Communist Party. These plans were carried out by
the Communist Party District Committee through the various trade
unions, front organizations, Progressive Party, and other organizations
which had been created or captured by the Communist Party in
western Pennsylvania.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_565">565</span></p>

<p>Did you confer at any time with any one from Pittsburgh with reference
to the strategy and planning of the fight against the Mundt bill
in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, sir, I did not. You mean by that a personal
conference with somebody from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you aware of the fact that it was the Communist
Party in that area which led and headed the fight against the
Mundt bill in connection with the program of the National Committee
To Defeat the Mundt Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I was not aware of that. I think as far as the
western area was concerned, I think the only contact we had was with
Alexander Wright, who was I think executive secretary of the Progressive
Party out there and I never talked with him personally.</p>

<p>I think he corresponded with the committee or sent some communication
and we in turn sent a wire or material to him but I don’t remember
any contact with anybody else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he known to you to be a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, he was not. In fact, I don’t know him. I
have never even met him. Whatever communication we had was by
mail or by wire, as I remember. I don’t know him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He was identified by Matthew Cvetic as an active
member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Alexander Wright?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Alexander Wright, W-r-i-g-h-t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Communication by the committee was as executive
secretary of the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Isn’t it a fact, Mr. O’Connell, that the situation
which Mr. Cvetic described in Pittsburgh with reference to the
strategy and planning by the Communist Party for the fight against
the Mundt-Nixon bill was duplicated in many instances and many
places throughout the United States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I said, my work was here in Washington and
what actually took place, either in Pittsburgh or any other section of
the country, I wouldn’t know. Certainly my guess would be and
certainly my feeling would be that inasmuch as the legislation was
proscribing the Communist Party and affecting it, they certainly
worked on it and certainly did what they could to defeat it. I have
no doubt about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the Progressive Party in the State of Washington
active in promoting the fight against the passage of the Mundt
bill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Wasn’t a good part of the leadership of the Progressive
Party in the State of Washington of Communist Party
membership?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as the leadership of the Progressive Party
was concerned, as I stated yesterday, Mr. Russell Fluent was the
chairman; he was at the time of his chairmanship Democratic State
treasurer in the State of Washington; I feel sure was not a member of
the Communist Party; Mr. L. C. Hunterer was national committeeman;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_566">566</span>
he was Democratic sheriff in Olympia in Thurston County and
I am sure was not a member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>I think at one time he used to be&mdash;out in the Western States we have
Old Greenbacks and Old Populace and former followers of the Progressive
Party under Bob La Follette, but Mr. Hunterer was not.
Elsie Hoffman, who was national committeewoman, was president of
the Democratic Women’s Club in the city of Spokane, and I am sure
was not a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What about Tom Rabbitt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Tom Rabbitt worked for a short time in the Progressive
Party, I would say from probably April of maybe&mdash;I would
say latter part of March or early part of April 1948 until latter part
of May of 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What about William J. Pennock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am pretty sure that&mdash;well, Mr. Pennock had
no office in the Progressive Party. I think he was a member of
the executive committee. We had a very, very large executive committee,
and I think he was a member of the executive committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What about John Daschbach?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t remember any Progressive Party in activity
in my time on the part of John Daschbach.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, will you tell the committee what
action the Communist Party took in protesting to Judge Medina
during the trial of the 11 Communists under the provisions of the
Smith Act in Foley Square, New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Outside of what was in the ordinary press notices,
I mean of my own knowledge, I don’t know anything. I read about
the trial and so on, but of my own knowledge I don’t know anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the leadership of the Progressive Party in
the State of Washington take any active part in protesting to Judge
Medina regarding the trial of the 11 Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. When was that trial?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The trial was in 1949; I think the first motion of
the trial was disposed of in the spring of 1949 before they began
the trial on its merits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wouldn’t want to say categorically one way or
the other what action might have been taken by the Progressive
Party in the State of Washington in that connection. I can’t recall
anything right now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you as executive secretary have any part in
the activity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t remember any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I hand you a photostatic copy of the June 6, 1949,
issue of the Daily Worker and call your attention to an article
entitled “Men of Labor and Civic Leaders Throughout Nation Voice
Indignation,” and I ask if you see in that article a reference to the
fact that Henry Huff, chairman, and Clayton Van Lydegraf, secretary
of the Washington State Communist Party, having wired
Dennis in connection with those trials. Do you see that paragraph?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I see that paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The subject of the wire is quoted as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The northwest district is proud and inspired by the splendid fight the defendants
are making against the biased conduct and vicious rulings of Judge
Medina who is acting as prosecutor at Foley Square. The jailing of John Gates,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_567">567</span>
Gus Hall, and Henry Winston has shocked and aroused our party and the
massed forces to a new fighting pitch and widespread protest action.</p></blockquote>

<p>Will you examine the article again, please, and state whether just
above the paragraph pointed out to you there is the description of a
telegram sent by Russell Fluent, chairman, and Jerry O’Connell, executive
secretary of the Progressive Party to Judge Medina. Do you
see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I see that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you read it into the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span> (reading):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Russell Fluent, chairman, and Jerry O’Connell, executive secretary of the
Progressive Party, wired Medina “Thousands of members are shocked at your
willful, unlawful, and unconstitutional attempt to deny any defense to the
Communist Party leaders now on trial.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. That was sent by whom to whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. This paper&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Alleged to have been sent by whom to whom? What
does the paper say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The paper says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Russell Fluent, chairman, and Jerry O’Connell, executive secretary of the
Progressive Party wired Medina “Thousands of members shocked at your willful,
unlawful, and unconstitutional attempt to deny any defense to the Communist
Party leaders now on trial.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you send that wire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t remember sending any such wire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Would you state in view of the report of the Daily
Worker that the wire was not sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I just have no recollection of sending that
wire, myself sending it. It is a long time ago and I don’t know who
wrote that story or how it was acquired or anything. I can’t remember.
I just can’t remember sending any wire in that connection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire to offer the document in evidence and ask
that it be marked “O’Connell Exhibit No. 5” for identification purposes
only, and to be made a part of the committee files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. It is so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I might say your showing me this paper is the first
time that has ever been called to my attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The sending of this telegram to Judge Medina was
not the first occasion you have publicly come to the support of the
Communist Party, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I wouldn’t want to say that I came to the
support of the Communist Party. As a progressive American, I believe
that all people regardless of their political opinions and beliefs
are entitled to their political rights and civil liberties, whether they
be Communists or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. According to your statement, do you consider that
the Communist Party is a political party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as my information is concerned, I know
there are findings by the Congress that it is not, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And also by the courts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t recall any by the courts. I can’t recall
any case by the courts. Cases I can recall hold otherwise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. There are court cases.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_568">568</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I don’t want to argue about it. The thing
is that as an American I feel that all people, regardless of their political
opinions or beliefs, whether they are Communist or non-Communists,
are entitled to their rights to their political opinions and beliefs
and to their civil rights and to their civil liberties as provided by our
Constitution. I say that as a progressive American who really honestly
and sincerely believes it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I think we all believe that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I didn’t get you, Congressman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I said I think we all believe in the statement you
made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was just expressing&mdash;that is my position on it.
I just think it is dangerous to proscribe&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You undertook in this telegram to accuse the judge
of willful, unlawful, and unconstitutional attempt to deny the Communist
Party leaders any defense.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I said, I don’t remember sending that wire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do you deny it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, Congressman, I can’t say. I just don’t have
any recollection of sending that wire, and I am saying that honestly
and truthfully. I did think, and I still do think, that Judge Medina
did restrict their defense at the trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. We have had some of the lawyers who appeared before
Judge Medina in that trial appear before this committee, and
I am just wondering how Judge Medina withstood the assault that
was made upon him, not only by those lawyers but by telegrams such
as the counsel has just read, which, of course, I believe you sent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Congressman, I really&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I think that was an attack on our judicial system
that was a disgrace by those who participated in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I have said, I really don’t remember sending
any such wire, and this is the first time that has ever been called to
my attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. The Communists and their followers talk about persecution.
If ever a fine jurist was persecuted for attempting to do his
job, as he was required to do by law, Judge Medina was so persecuted
and smeared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I have not condoned the conduct of the attorneys
who were present at that trial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I understand that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think&mdash;you have been here most of the time
or a considerable part of the time I testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I might say your conduct has been exemplary, you
have been very respectful and we certainly have no complaint. You
have used, I am not criticizing you for it, what is used regularly in
matters such as this, namely, the convenient and overworked answers,
“I don’t remember” and “not to my recollection, et cetera.”</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. These things happened some 5 and 6 and 7 years
ago and it is not easy and all of these people are actually strangers to
me and all that. I came down here as a former Congressman, as a
political figure in the Democratic Party in my own right and so on,
I came here with a true and honest and firm belief in my opposition to
the Mundt bill at that time. I think that it was wrong and I think it is
wrong now.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_569">569</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I do not want anything I have said to appear as a
criticism of you. As I said, I think you have been very polite and very
respectful, but I think when certain statements are made it is incumbent
upon members of the committee to comment upon those statements
and clear the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I have been a Member of the House, sir, and I
have full respect for the committee and I realize, I have sat up there
and I have made my comments too as witnesses have testified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Have you been given every opportunity to make explanations
to answers you gave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I think that the members of the committee, then, have
a right of course to comment upon statements you have made, the
same as you have that privilege.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I have no complaint. I have been treated very
fairly and respectfully and everything, I have made no complaint
and I am doing my very level honest best to do a good job to answer
the questions as they are given to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall having spoken to the legislative conference
of the Freedom Crusade Congress of the Civil Right Congress
on the question of the indictment of the 12 Communist leaders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know what that Freedom Crusade is.
Where was that supposed to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. No. It was in Washington, D. C. According to
the Daily Worker of January 13, 1949, we find an article entitled
“Congressman To Address Crusade,” this paragraph:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The final panel on persecuted political minorities based on the indictments
of the 12 Communist leaders will be discussed by Marcantonio, Dr. W. E. B.
DuBois, and former Montana Congressman Jerry O’Connell.</p></blockquote>

<p>Do you recall whether you did speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am positive I did not. I have never met DuBois,
never met him in my life. I have never been involved with him. Marc
I know real well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do I understand you to say you don’t recall whether
you made the speech?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am positive I never spoke at any such panel.
Because I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall having agreed to appear on that program?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I surely don’t.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Is that the Daily Worker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do you mean the Daily Worker can be wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The reason I feel positive about that is I do not
know Dr. DuBois, I have never met him, and I don’t know him at all,
and I know I was not on any panel where he talked. I know I didn’t do
that. Marc of course I knew real well, but I certainly don’t remember
speaking any place with Marc. I knew him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you speak, regardless of who accompanied
you, on a program sponsored by the Freedom Crusade Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What date was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In January 1949.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_570">570</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am positive I did not.</p>

<p>The other reason I feel sure about that is I left the State of Washington
in October 1949, and I went back to Montana, and I know
during that particular period I was in the State of Montana and my
wife and I were living with her folks in Great Falls. I know my
financial circumstances at that time were very slim and that I am
sure, I am just positive that I never spoke at any such panel at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. A report is made by the Special Committee on Un-American
Activities that the Daily Worker issue of June 23, 1937,
page 1, carried a letter addressed by you to David Leeds, business manager
of the Daily Worker, official organ of the Communist Party, in
which you state:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I feel that the Daily Worker is America’s outstanding daily labor paper and
has done much during these past crucial labor years to bring true and accurate
accounts of labor conditions throughout the entire country to the attention of the
people.</p></blockquote>

<p>Did you write such a letter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I wrote such a letter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you a subscriber to the Daily Worker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I don’t think&mdash;I was a Member of Congress
at that time and the Daily Worker was delivered like a lot of other
newspapers are to my office. My particular recollection of that&mdash;that
is 1937&mdash;was that a man by the name of Paddy King was an avowed
Communist in the State of Montana and is quite a familiar character
around there came to my office and asked me if I would do this and
I think I told him I would confine it strictly to the labor coverage of
what the Daily Worker was doing, coverage on labor, on strikes, on
labor’s rights, and so on. I wrote the letter at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Was what you said in 1937 true about the Daily
Worker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That was written in 1937.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. 1937. It surely has changed since I became acquainted
with it. I have just been reading the account of some of the
hearings we had in Newark a couple of weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. A lot of things have changed since 1937.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I said if what you stated in 1937 was true about it,
the paper surely has changed since my acquaintance with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. You will remember that was the period in which
the CIO was beginning to organize and there was considerable, we
had the little steel strike, we had Memorial Day massacre at Republic
Steel near Chicago; there were many things happening in the labor
situation at that time, and in my opinion the Daily Worker covered
them better and did a better job than any other paper I knew of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You knew of course that the Daily Worker was
the official organ of the Communist Party, and that it was required
to be read by all Communist Party members in order to ascertain the
directives that were being issued by the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew that it was the organ of the Communist
Party but whether or not the members were required to do it, I was
not a Communist, I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Why did you desire to give aid to the Communist
Party by writing such a highly commendatory article to be printed
in the Daily Worker?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_571">571</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was dealing with the paper as such and particularly
with its labor coverage as such. I think I confined my letter
to that particular phase of the coverage that the Daily Worker
did. There was no intent on my part to give aid or support to the
Communist Party or anything&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it your purpose to get aid or support for yourself
from the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, not aid and support from the Communist
Party. I lived in western Montana and I was a Congressman from
western Montana where we had a very, very militant tradition out
there as far as labor was concerned. In that particular period and
of course during the depression and at other times, labor leaders had
been hanged out there, one labor leader was hanged to a railroad
trestle&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What has that to do with the question I asked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What I am trying to point out is that I lived in
a district, that I represented a district where there were a lot of
militant labor leaders who read the Daily Worker, who actually, many
of them I know, were not Communists, there wasn’t any particular
fear&mdash;there might have been 30 or 37 Communists in the whole State,
nobody was ever bothered about them, nobody was afraid of them.
As a politician they came to see me and talk with me, they came to
other politicians there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. I can remember&mdash;in the 33d&mdash;in the 33d Legislature
of Montana the Communist Party came and talked to the
legislative assembly while the legislature was assembled and all that
on the conditions that existed in the State at the time. There wasn’t
any, I am trying to put you in the pattern and in the spirit and in the
situation that existed in that day. We weren’t worried about them,
we weren’t afraid of them at all. We let them speak their piece, we let
them say the things they wanted to say, if they had any contribution
to make, to make it, and so on.</p>

<p>That is the attitude and that was not only true of them. We had
heavy Socialist following, the Socialist Party out there, Norman
Thomas had decidedly strong feeling, in fact strong support out there
and carried some of the counties in the State of Montana particularly
in my district in the 1932 election.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is put you in the mind and in the spirit that
existed as far as I was concerned at that particular time. For instance,
today I wouldn’t write that kind of a letter to the Daily Worker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did the same condition exist in Seattle, Wash.,
which you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In the State of Washington you had about the
same situation, in the history of the State there was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me ask you this question: Did members of the
Communist Party in Seattle come to you as secretary of the Progressive
Party to discuss Communist Party problems with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; not to discuss Communist Party problems as
such, both while I was executive secretary of the Democratic Party
and executive secretary of the Progressive Party I can remember Mr.
Henry P. Huff and Mr. Van Lydegraf, I think there was a Mr. Remes,
and others who came to the Democratic Party office and to the Progressive
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_572">572</span>
Party Office and made certain representations about support
of the legislation they were interested in, matters that they were taking
a position in, and so on. I talked with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did that also include Tom Rabbitt and William
Pennock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, in my time out there Rabbitt and Pennock
had never been identified or identified themselves as members of the
Communist Party. As I told you, Rabbitt was Democratic State senator,
Pennock was Democratic State representative and their dealings
with me, they were delegates to the Democratic Central Committee in
King County and their dealings with me were, as far as I knew, and
ostensibly they dealt with me as members of the Democratic party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. We have spoken of the Daily Worker. You say
you were not a subscriber. Were you a subscriber to the Daily People’s
World?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t think I ever subscribed to the People’s
World. I got the New World. I was a subscriber to the New World
and to the Washington New Dealer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were acquainted, were you not, with a paper
published in Chicago by the name of Midwest Daily Record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t remember the Midwest Daily Record.
When was that published?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In the thirties. Do you recall having written a
letter to the Daily Worker or made a public pronouncement recommending
the publication of that paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I don’t. Was it a Communist newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Did it exist any time? Did it last any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Not for a long period. I don’t know the period it
existed. As I understand, you do not recall anything about that
paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I honestly can’t remember anything about it. I
didn’t even know it existed as far as I can remember. When I was
down here in Congress there were a lot of newspapers and I am trying
to think of some of them. A lot of them came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, were you acquainted with John T.
Bernard, former Member of Congress?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir; I was a Member of the House in the 75th
Congress with Mr. Bernard and I have seen him on several occasions
since that time and I am acquainted with Mr. Bernard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I have before me the January 8, 1938, issue of the
Daily Worker carrying an article entitled “‘I Am for the Loyalists
and China,’ Police Captain Declares at Lincoln Vets Trial.” The last
paragraph of this article states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A dinner in honor of Robert Raven was given by the friends of the Abraham
Lincoln Brigade last night at the Aldine Club, 200 Fifth Avenue. Congressman
John T. Bernard, Farmer-Laborite of Minnesota, paid tribute to the heroic death
of Raven, and gave some account of his experiences while visiting Spanish battle-grounds
with Jerry O’Connell, Congressman of Montana. Other speakers were
Steve Nelson. * * *</p></blockquote>

<p>Did you accompany John T. Bernard to the Spanish battlefields?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When were you in Spain and for what period of
time?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_573">573</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. You are really getting into ancient history. My
best recollection was that we were in Spain, I would say sometime in
the month of October 1938 or maybe the latter part of October or
early November 1938, somewhere in that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long were you there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I would say about 3 weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. As part of your experience there, did you and Mr.
Bernard take part in the review of the American Brigade, Anglo-American
Brigade, on the occasion of the celebration of the anniversary
of the Russian Revolution? Do you recall reviewing the
troops?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I remember reviewing the troops but not in connection
with any celebration of the Russian Revolution. As I remember,
the only troops we reviewed were troops that came up when there
was a change of command. The command of the brigade was to be
taken over by somebody, I can’t remember who they were now, but
certainly not in connection with any celebration of the Soviet Revolution.
At least I certainly was not informed that that was the case.
I had been active, while I was a Member of Congress, before I went
to Spain I was very decidedly and very specifically on the side of the
Spanish Republic, I did everything I could to promote American policy
to help and to aid the Spanish Loyalists. They were the legally
elected government of Spain, they were being attacked by Hitler and
Mussolini as I saw it, and in my opinion it was the beginning, in fact
the first battlefield of World War II.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee, please, who invited you
and the circumstances under which you made the trip?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, earlier in that year a group of Congressmen
in the 75th Congress, we had a group of Congressmen known as the
liberal bloc of Congress headed by Maury Maverick of Texas. The
newspapers described us as all fairly young. I was only 27 at the time.
We were described as Young Turks and out of that liberal bloc a group
of us, 5 or 6 or maybe 4 or 5, went to see Secretary of State Cordell
Hull in connection with the Spanish situation and also legislation
which was pending with reference to invoking the Neutrality Act as
it existed at that time against Germany and Italy for their intervention
in Spain, and Mr. Hull told us as far as this Government was
concerned there was actually no evidence of Spanish and German
intervention or I should say German and Italian intervention.</p>

<p>I think I later, along with Congressman Coffee and Congressman
Bernard and others, talked with David Niles, who was then executive
assistant to President Roosevelt in connection with the situation. It
was then suggested, I think just about the time Congress was adjourning,
Mrs. O’Connell and I had been married on the 2d of January 1937,
and we had had no honeymoon and were going to Europe.</p>

<p>My mother and father were both born in Ireland and I had always
wanted to go there and we did go to Ireland, to England, France, and
so on, had a reception at the Spanish Embassy, I would say probably
about a month before adjournment or shortly before adjournment,
Ambassador de Los Rios invited not only myself but Congressman
Bernard and several other Congressmen to go to Spain and investigate
what the situation was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he the person who extended the invitation to
go to Spain?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_574">574</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. He was the one. We of course took care
of our own arrangements here, got our passport from the State Department&mdash;I
think we were issued special passports by the State Department.
Our visas were procured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was any contribution made to you for the expenses
of this trip for you and your wife, either for transportation or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. We paid our own passage. I think we went
over on the <i>Queen Mary</i> and came back on the <i>Normandy</i>. We paid
all of our hotel expenses and we traveled by plane from Le Bourget to
Croydon and paid for those. I spent about a month in Ireland where
my folks were born and all those expenses were paid by me and in
Spain we were the guests of the Spanish Republic and there were no
expenses for hotel and transportation in Spain itself.</p>

<p>Our entry into Spain was expedited by the American Embassy in
Paris. I think Robert Murphy was then Minister Plenipotentiary at
the time and Acting Ambassador and he had Col. Steven Fuquay,
who was military attaché of the American Embassy in Spain to meet
us at the airport at Valencia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. After your return to this country, did you then become
affiliated with organizations which have since been designated
as front organizations relating to the Spanish problem?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I don’t know whether you could define it as
affiliated&mdash;I made speeches before many groups that were involved in
the fighting in behalf of the Spanish Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you become one of the sponsors of the Medical
Bureau and North American Committee To Aid Spanish Democracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Right now I don’t remember whether I did, but
I wouldn’t be a bit surprised. I am sure I did everything I could&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I find your name on the letterhead of that organization
on July 6, 1938. Does that refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I haven’t seen it but if I am on there&mdash;I want to
say I did everything I could to save the Spanish Republic. I felt very
intensely about it. I am proud of what I did. I feel the same way
about it today as I did then.</p>

<p>I think the position that I took as far as history was concerned was
later in the establishment of the United Nations and disbarment of
Franco Spain from the United Nations at least vindication of the
position that I had taken. But in July of 1938 certainly that committee
or that organization whose letterhead you say I am a sponsor
on was not listed as a subversive organization or so described by
anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. An examination of the letterhead of American Relief
Ship for Spain bearing date of September 3, 1938, reflects you
as one of the sponsors of this organization. Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t recall it but I am sure it is true. As I
said, I worked every way I knew how for defeat of Franco and for
the saving of the Spanish Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you appear on a program of the Fourth National
Congress of the American League for Peace and Democracy in
Pittsburgh in November 1937?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. November 26 to 28, 1937.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_575">575</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I remember I missed the Army-Navy game. It
rained and I was anxious to get to it. I remember I spoke at that
meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was that in behalf of the Loyalist cause?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It was in connection with Loyalist Spain. I think
there was a resolution pending in the Congress to invoke the Neutrality
Act against Germany and Italy for intervention and I think also
removal of the embargo which had been placed against Spain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you from time to time appear before various
meetings of the Veterans of the Lincoln Brigade, and speak on the
subject of the Spanish cause?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t remember how many times. My present
recollection of that, which, of course, is some 17 or 18 years ago, is
that I made 1 or 2 speeches at meetings of the Friends of the Abraham
Lincoln Brigade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In the course of the making of those speeches did
you become acquainted with Steve Nelson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, sir; I never ever met Steve Nelson; have never
met Steve Nelson to this day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I notice in the Daily Worker issue of July 8, 1937,
that you were listed to speak along with Earl Browder and others
on July 19. This was prior to your trip to Spain?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. As I remember from the date that was the
first anniversary of the beginning of the Spanish War and it was
a meeting, as I remember, in Madison Square Garden and the speakers
included&mdash;I know Fiorello LaGuardia spoke there. I know Norman
Thomas, the candidate for the Socialist Party spoke there; a Republican
Representative in Congress also spoke there. I spoke as a
Democrat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Who was the Representative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If I remember, he was from one of the New York
districts, I am not too sure which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Do you remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really don’t. The purpose of the meeting as it
was outlined was to have a representative of all of the political parties
speak at the meeting. Did Marcantonio speak there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He is listed as one of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. At that time I am pretty sure Marc was a Republican
Representative or had been a Republican Representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. Marcantonio was a Republican Representative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; he was. He came to Congress as a Republican
Representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I understand how that happened. Was he the one
you are referring to or was it somebody else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am not sure. I know there was a representative
of every political party that spoke there on the Spanish situation and
in favor of the Spanish Republic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Scherer</span>. I understand that, but might it have been Marcantonio
you were referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My remembrance is it was somebody else, but I
don’t want to&mdash;I am trying to think. As a matter of fact, he was from
one of the silk-stocking districts of New York, as I remember.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_576">576</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. We will adjourn until 2 o’clock.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 12:30 p. m. the committee was recessed, to reconvene
at 2 p. m. the same day.)</p>

<h2>AFTERNOON SESSION, JUNE 2, 1955</h2>

<p>The subcommittee reconvened at 2 p. m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The subcommittee will come to order.</p>

<p>Because of the pressure of legislative work, as we have gone along
in these hearings it has been necessary to constitute and reconstitute
the subcommittee.</p>

<p>Mr. Scherer could not be here this afternoon and the chairman
has now appointed a subcommittee of my colleagues, Mr. Velde, and
Mr. Doyle, and myself as chairman.</p>

<p>In view of the reconstitution of the subcommittee we will reswear
the witness.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that you will testify according to the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, before this subcommittee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF JEREMIAH JOSEPH O’CONNELL&mdash;Resumed</h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, were you a member of the national
committee of the International Labor Defense in 1940?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The Daily Worker of May 3, 1938, reports that
Jeremiah O’Connell was a speaker at a function of the International
Labor Defense.</p>

<p>According to Equal Justice, page 4, of the November 1938 issue,
Jeremiah O’Connell was one of the sponsors of the Christmas drive of
that organization.</p>

<p>According to the May 1939 issue of Equal Justice, Jeremiah O’Connell
was one of those who sent congratulations to the southern California
district year book 1938 of the International Labor Defense.</p>

<p>According to a leaflet the summer milk fund drive, Hotel Pennsylvania,
New York City, of June 13, 1940, you were listed as a member
of that committee of the International Labor Defense.</p>

<p>Now, does that information refresh your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. I mean I can’t&mdash;I don’t remember ever being
elected to the international committee of the International Labor Defense,
or selected for it.</p>

<p>I probably, as a Congressman, like on the milk fund, summer milk
fund and Christmas fund, and so on, at that time the International
Labor Defense used to send, I think Christmas presents to labor
prisoners.</p>

<p>During my term in Congress I was particularly active in fighting
for the freedom of Tom Mooney. My Dad had been in the miner’s
union, a member and executive for that particular period; he has always
been interested. When I came here I introduced a resolution
in the Congress asking for the freedom of Tom Mooney and for a
pardon for him.</p>

<p>I think my best recollection is as far as the International Labor Defense
is concerned that the matters I sponsored were around prisoners
like Tom Mooney.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_577">577</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you familiar with the fact that it has been cited
as a Communist front organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I shouldn’t say that I actually know that it has
been cited, or when it was cited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Attorney General Tom Clark cited it as a subversive
and Communist organization on June 1, 1948, and again on September
22, 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It wasn’t even in existence then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Probably not. Attorney General Francis Biddle,
on September 24, 1942, cited it as a legal arm of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>This committee on January 3, 1939, again on January 3, 1940; on
June 25, 1942; and on March 29, 1944, cited it. In this committee’s
citation it was referred to as the American section of the MOPR Red
International of Labor Defense, often referred to as the Red International
Aid.</p>

<p>It was subsequently combined with the National Federation of Constitutional
Liberties to form the Civil Rights Congress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. O’Connell, as a former Member of Congress, naturally
you were interested in the citations of the Un-American Activities
Committee and the citation of the Attorneys General. Surely
you must have some recollection that these organizations were subversive
and cited as subversive by duly constituted bodies?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Actually, I mean as far as the International Labor
Defense is concerned, I think the latest, according to that record, that
I was involved is sometime in 1940. I think its earliest citation was
by this committee in 1939.</p>

<p>Then the Attorney General’s citations were many years after that
when it was actually in existence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. 1942?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. 1942.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes, sir; you said many years later; 1942 is the
date that the Attorney General first cited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I thought you said 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. There was one in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. O’Connell, I understood you to say that you didn’t
know that the International Labor Defense was a subversive organization
or cited as a subversive organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I actually didn’t know at the time I was involved
there. I, for instance, know now that the International Labor Defense
has been, and I have known it for some time in the past few years
since it was cited.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. How long have you known it has been cited?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My best recollection would be that I have probably
known since 1945, somewhere in there; maybe a little earlier, but
certainly at this time I didn’t know it.</p>

<p>For instance, I am out in the State of Montana. A lot of this material
is not covered by the press in Montana, and it does not have any
particular interest, and, of course, I was not involved; I was no longer
a Member of Congress at that time.</p>

<p>I had a sincere desire, I actually believed, and felt that Tom Mooney
had been framed, and I felt that he ought to be released from prison.
I worked for his freedom.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_578">578</span></p>

<p>I think, in one instance, as far as the International Labor Defense
is concerned, I was going into Jersey City to speak against Mayor
Frank Hague. The meeting that I was speaking at apparently was
sponsored by Norman Thomas’ Socialist Party, or they were the ones
that had arranged it, and members of the International Labor Defense
requested me not to speak, but I went there and spoke.</p>

<p>At that time, to my best recollection, Mike Quill was the New York
labor leader and still is. He was prevailing upon me not to go in there
and speak, but I did go into Jersey City and tried to speak there. I
felt that Frank Hague was denying civil liberties and particularly
freedom of speech.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. But at that time did you not realize that the International
Labor Defense had been cited by your Government as being
subversive?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Congressman, at that time I was 27, 28 years old.
My political experience, particularly as far as Socialists were concerned,
as far as Communists were concerned, and all of that, I had
no training or study in Marxism-Leninism.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, I had very little knowledge of what the differences
were, what their division of opinion was, or anything of the
kind.</p>

<p>My feeling was that both of them were for socialism and I didn’t
know what their particular division was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What I am getting at is this: As a Member of Congress,
following your defeat as a Member of Congress, you certainly were
interested in the committees of Congress, you certainly were interested
in what the Attorney General of the United States was doing. It
seems to me that you should have been cognizant of the fact that the
International Labor Defense was cited as a subversive organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. This is the first time today&mdash;no, for instance, this
committee had cited the International Labor Defense at that particular
date. Now, I learned later&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Now, Mr. O’Connell, there have been a lot of witnesses
appear before this committee with a lot less intelligence than you,
with a lot less knowledge of political activities of our Government,
and, of course, we realize that there were a lot of those people who
became involved in the Communist Party and the Communist Party
manipulations.</p>

<p>But I just cannot understand how you, as a Member of Congress,
would not be cognizant of the fact that the International Labor Defense
was cited as a subversive organization.</p>

<p>I don’t question whether you believed it was, or was not; or whether
you believed that the Attorney General or this committee was right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I said that I later knew, but at the particular time
involved here, Congressman, it had not been, in my first connection
with it, had not been cited by the committee as such.</p>

<p>I can’t remember this milk fund in 1940, or whatever it was, but I
presume it was to raise funds to provide milk for prisoners, labor prisoners,
children of labor prisoners, and so on. I don’t remember specifically
about&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Now, as far as my particular situation was concerned, the way I
felt about these things, I mean for instance whether it was Mooney
or whoever it might have been, I made up my mind so far as my judgment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_579">579</span>
was concerned, what I thought was right and what I thought
was wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Certainly you have that privilege, as we all do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. And I worked to accomplish what I thought was
right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I am not questioning your privilege, your right, to make
up your own mind. I am questioning the facts, your statement that
you did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. About the best way to explain it to you, I came
out of a district, I was born and raised in Butte. Butte is a mining
town&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. But you had been to Washington, D. C. Even before
you ran for Congress you had been here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I had gone to school here, yes.</p>

<p>In that particular day when I went to school here, as I remember,
there wasn’t any great discussion about Communists or Socialists or
anything of that kind. When I went to school here in that day, I was
in the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Chairman, I do not see that this argument is getting
us anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The biggest thing of interest at that time was Al
Smith and Governor Ritchie and other people’s nominations for the
Presidency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, were you a member of the national
committee of the American League for Peace and Democracy
in 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know whether I was in 1939, but maybe in
1938 or 1937, and possibly 1939 I was a member of the American League
for Peace and Democracy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. How long were you a member that organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really wouldn’t know. Actually after I went
back to Montana, outside of some communication and sponsorship,
something of that kind, I had very little connection. As I remember,
the League didn’t last; I mean it didn’t last very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. While you were a member of its national committee,
did you take part as a speaker in various functions of the
American League for Peace and Democracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think I can remember about two speeches. I made
a speech in Pittsburgh that you asked me about, and I made a speech
in New York, at a banquet in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you remain a member of the national committee
of the American League for Peace and Democracy until its dissolution?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. When did it dissolve?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In 1941.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I couldn’t say whether I remained a member
all of that time. I don’t know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. During the course of the hearing before this committee
the chairman read into the record minutes of an executive committee
meeting of the American League for Peace and Democracy,
held on January 23, 1939. I quote from what the chairman read into
the record:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_580">580</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In connection with the legislative program it says: “Get lists of friendly Congressmen
and have teas and luncheons for them.”</p>

<p>A further idea of how they proceed is shown in the minutes of January 13, 1939,
of the meeting held at the home of Mrs. Fowler, as follows:</p>

<p>“It was suggested that we make an attempt to get Congressmen to join the
league. Mr. Smith will arrange for a luncheon meeting with Marcantonio and
Jerry O’Connell to get their views on how to proceed. The idea is to make Congressmen
part of an impressive list of sponsors.”</p></blockquote>

<p>and from the same minutes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Mr. Berrall announced a legislative office will be established in Washington
over the weekend with Jerry O’Connell doing the congressional work and two
assistants at the office.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Will you explain what your activity was among Congressmen to
solicit membership in the American League for Peace and Democracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. When was this supposed to be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The minutes of the executive meeting were January
13, 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was no longer a Member of Congress in 1939.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I didn’t say that you were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Then I was supposed to head some kind of office
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Berrall announced that a legislative office will
be established in Washington&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. What is this Mr. Berrall? Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I don’t know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span> (reading):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Berrall announced that a legislative office will be established in Washington
over the weekend with Jerry O’Connell doing the congressional work and two
assistants at the office.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as I am concerned he is talking out of thin
air. I had nothing to do with any office. I wasn’t in a legislative office
down here for the American League for Peace and Democracy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Where were you in January 1939?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, my best recollection would be that in January
1939 I was back in the State of Montana. After I was defeated for
Congress I started a weekly newspaper called Jerry O’Connell’s Montana
Liberal.</p>

<p>I am pretty sure I was back there getting that paper underway and
getting it published and so on, trying to get subscriptions. I just
think he is talking out of complete thin air because I certainly never
came down here and did any kind of work like that, or talked to any
Congressmen or had teas for them or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall when you left Washington at the end
of the Congress in which you served?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t think after my defeat that I came back
here at all. I was defeated, of course, in November 1938. I think
my secretary came back and cleaned up what we had in the office and
brought it back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I would like the record to show
that the American League for Peace and Democracy was cited as subversive
and Communist by Attorney General Francis Biddle on September
24, 1942, in the following language:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_581">581</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Established in the United States in 1937 as successor to the American League
against War and Fascism in an effort to create public sentiment on behalf of
the foreign policy adapted to the interest of the Soviet Union. The American
League for Peace and Democracy was designed to conceal Communist control
in accordance with the new tactics of the Communist International.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire a little further on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Were you acquainted with any of the leaders of the
movement of the American League for Peace and Democracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, about the only one I can remember, that
stands out in my mind, was Dr. Harry F. Ward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you know Dr. Harry F. Ward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew him at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You still know him, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I think if he walked in the room I don’t
know whether I would recognize him. I would say it has probably
been 10 or almost 15 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. At that time he was head of the Methodist Federation
of Social Action. I presume you know that, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My impression was that he was head of this organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Will you answer my question? Did you know that he
was head of the Methodist Federation for Social Action at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I really didn’t know whether he was or not.
My impression was that it was somebody by the name of Jack McMichael
that was head of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. If my memory serves me correctly, it was not until
after that time. It was 1942. Am I right, that Jack McMichael
became head of the Methodist Federation for Social Action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. This was quite a while ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. What contact did you have with Harry Ward as far
as the American League for Peace and Democracy was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. About the only contact I had with him, I don’t
know whether he personally, but somebody before him, asked me to
speak at a convention or meeting they had out in Pittsburgh in
November 1937.</p>

<p>Then there was a banquet as I recall; I think after that time, something
in the early part of 1938, in New York, where he asked me to
speak and, of course, he presided at the banquet in New York. I
don’t know whether it was at Pittsburgh, or whether he resided there,
or not, but I remember his presiding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you have any idea why he asked you to speak before
the meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think because of my position on foreign policy
and particularly on Spain at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you know any other leaders in the movement for
the American League for Peace and Democracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The only one I recall now is Dr. Ward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Possibly I can refresh his recollection on that.
Wasn’t Earl Browder one of the leaders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. I really don’t know. If he were,
any connection I had with the league&mdash;I mean I had certainly nothing
to do with him. I mean, he wasn’t involved at the meeting that I
spoke to in New York or the meeting I spoke to in Pittsburgh. I
never saw Browder or knew he was involved in it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_582">582</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In the extract from the minutes of the executive
meeting which I read a few moments ago&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Where was this executive meeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It was held in the home of Mrs. Fowler, on January
13, 1939. Now, it was suggested at that meeting, according to what
I read, that a person by the name of Mr. Smith would get in touch
with Marcantonio and Jerry O’Connell to get their advice on how to
proceed.</p>

<p>Did anyone confer with you as to how to proceed to get Congressmen
to lend their names as sponsors so as to form an impressive list for the
American League for Peace and Democracy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; certainly nobody got in touch with me. I
don’t know of any Smith who got in touch with me. I know I never
had anything to do; I never came down here and tried to give Congressmen
teas. I don’t know who this Mrs. Fowler is; I don’t know
who Berrall is.</p>

<p>I think they were talking through their hat so far as I was concerned.
I mean, I can’t speak for Marc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you recall having been a speaker at the function
of American Friends of the Chinese People in June of 1938?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; that was in New York, was it not? A banquet
in New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Or was that a meeting here in Washington? I
think that was just after the Japanese aggression in China.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Are you now aware that the American Friends of
the Chinese People has been cited by this committee as a Communist-front
organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I am not aware of that even now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It was so cited on March 29, 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I never got copies of the hearings or deliberations
or decisions of the committee. Out there our press, unless it is specifically
related to something out there, rarely carries any of this
material.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The November 1948 issue of the Far East Spotlight
reflects that you sent greetings to the Communist, Madame Sun Yat-Sen
under auspices of the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern
Policy. Do you recall having done that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I really don’t recall having done it, but I don’t
deny that I did. I have tremendous respect for Madame Sun Yat-Sen.
I wouldn’t be a bit surprised.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you tell the committee whether or not you were
affiliated with the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Affiliated with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In any way; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. What is the name of that committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. A Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t remember&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When you say you probably did join in such a
greeting, can you recall the circumstances under which the Committee
for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy obtained your assistance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I really don’t recall how it was done or who
contacted me, or who asked me or anything. I am sure that if somebody
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_583">583</span>
asked me to send a greeting to Madame Sun Yat-Sen I might
have done it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The record should show at this point that the Committee
for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy was cited as a Communist
organization by Attorney General Tom Clark on April 27, 1949.</p>

<p>Were you acquainted with Mother Bloor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes; I knew Mother Bloor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What were the circumstances under which you
knew her?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am pretty sure that she came here to Washington
and I was introduced to her here in Washington when I was in Congress,
or if not, I probably&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did you know her to be a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. How did you know she was a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think she said she was and was an avowed Communist.
I don’t think she hid it or anything of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. What is the name of that person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Mother Bloor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. B-l-o-o-r.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I recall, she came to see me in connection with
my resolution in behalf of freedom for Tom Mooney. I am pretty
sure that is how I met her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you send her this greeting on her 75th birthday:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It affords me great pleasure to add my word of commendation and praise to
Mother Bloor and to wish her well on the occasion of the celebration in her
honor. When the final history of the movement of labor throughout the world
is written, I know that proper tribute will be paid to her for her militant and
unceasing fight for the betterment of the classes that toil and I am happy and
proud to be one of those who join in paying honor and tribute to her on this
day of memorable celebration. With the sender’s personal regards and every
good wish, I greet her.</p></blockquote>

<p>Did you send such a greeting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know. When was this supposed to be
sent?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. On her 75th birthday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I mean, when was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not certain as to the date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I mean she was a real character. I am trying to
recall. My dad was killed in a strike out in Butte and another organizer
of the miners union was taken and hung at the Milwaukee
trestle there. Whether Mother Bloor came out during that period
or not, I really don’t know.</p>

<p>But she, at least when I was&mdash;she was a very old lady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I can give you the date. It is July 18, 1937.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It was her 75th birthday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I can’t recall the wire. I don’t remember sending
it, but I wouldn’t deny that I had greeted her on her 75th birthday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was that part of a plan of a group of people to
add to her celebration?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_584">584</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Connell</span>. I mean, I can’t recall any of the facts.</p>

<p>I don’t know who held the celebration, or under what auspices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Let me see if I can refresh your recollection:</p>

<p>It is a fact that there was a celebration committee established to
celebrate the 75th birthday of Mother Bloor, an open Communist in
this country, throughout the width and breadth of the land, and that
you were a member of that celebrating committee? Or, I should
correct that and say that you were a sponsor of that celebration
committee?</p>

<p>I have before me a letterhead showing that Congressman Jerry J.
O’Connell was one of a list of sponsors for that celebration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Connell</span>. I can’t recall the circumstances now, but as far
as Mother Bloor was concerned, I am sure that I would have sent her
some greetings on her 75th birthday, and if I am listed there as a
sponsor&mdash;I don’t recall it now, but I don’t deny that I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire to introduce the document in evidence, and
ask that it be marked “O’Connell Exhibit No. 6” for identification
only, and to be made a part of the committee files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. It is so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The National Federation for Constitutional Liberties
in January 1943 addressed a message to the House of Representatives
critical of the Dies committee and calling for its abolishment.
A number of signatories appear to that letter and among them
appears your name. It appears in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I hereby join in signing the January 1943 message to the House of Representatives
opposing renewal of the Dies committee.</p></blockquote>

<p>There were a number of signatories, including Jerry O’Connell.
Do you recall that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Connell</span>. I don’t recall, but I voted against the creation of
the Dies committee in 1938 and I have constantly opposed it all the
time it was in existence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Now, in asking the question I am not critical in
any sense and don’t mean it in any sense, because of your decision to
oppose a congressional committee. That is a right that anyone has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Connell</span>. Well, I was a Member of Congress and I had a
right to vote against it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Not only as a Member of Congress, but as a citizen
you had that right. I don’t intend it in any way as critical, but my
purpose in asking it is to find out what connection you had with the
National Federation for Constitutional Liberties which put out this
message.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Connell</span>. So far as I can remember they probably sent me
a copy of that message and asked me if I would join in it. And then
I think I was the sponsor of a call to organize or set up the National
Federation for Constitutional Liberties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I think I have already read into the record the
citations by the Attorneys General Clark and Biddle of that organization.
So I will not repeat it.</p>

<p>I asked you this morning about the activity of John Daschbach in
connection with the Civil Rights Congress in the State of Washington.
According to the committee’s information, he was chairman of the
steering committee of that organization. Is that true?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_585">585</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t know whether he was chairman of the steering
committee. I remember he was the director in charge of the Civil
Rights Congress office in Seattle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Didn’t he name you as one of the members of the
steering committee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If he did, I had no knowledge of it. When did
he name me? When was this done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. In October of 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He may have put me on there, but I never served
as a member of the steering committee in the Civil Rights Congress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Why didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I just remember I didn’t. In October of 1948
particularly we were in the midst of the 1948 campaign and I was
the executive secretary of the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The campaign would have been over in November;
would it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, sir; it would have been, but I mean from
October&mdash;October is always involved in politics, October is the month
when the general election campaign is carried on.</p>

<p>He, of his own volition, may have made me a member of the steering
committee, but I certainly don’t remember getting any notification
and I certainly know I didn’t serve on the steering committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, you have repeated a number of
times during the course of the testimony your denial of any knowledge
of Communist Party membership on the part of Tom Rabbitt and
William Pennock while you were in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Now, I have examined the testimony taken at the Canwell hearings&mdash;which
occurred in 1948; did they not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I remember, there were two hearings out there.
There was one in 1947&mdash;I think there was a hearing in 1947, and one
in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The first hearings were conducted from January 27,
to February 5 of 1947, and subsequent hearings were, or at least the
report was made in 1948. I am not sure whether the bulk of the hearings
were in 1947 or in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think, as I remember, the longer hearings were
in 1947 and then there were some shorter hearings held in 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Now, I have examined this testimony and I find
that Louis Budenz identified Tom Rabbitt, as a member of the Communist
Party during the course of that hearing. He was the first
witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If the committee please, I think Mr. Budenz at
that hearing was asked questions about whether or not I was a member
of the Communist Party and I think the records will show there
that he didn’t definitely say that I was. He said that there was some
discussion about me in Communist Party headquarters, and that I
had a good record in Congress and the Communists thought I was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I will give you an opportunity to explain that a
little later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Don’t let me forget because I sued Mr. Budenz
about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I will give you an opportunity to explain that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Sued whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I sued Mr. Budenz for the statements that he made.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_586">586</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Ward F. Warren identified Thomas Rabbitt
as a person he knew to be a member of the Communist Party, that he
sat in closed party meetings with Thomas Rabbitt.</p>

<p>Senator James Sullivan identified Thomas Rabbitt as a member
of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Kathryn Fogg, K-a-t-h-r-y-n, identified Thomas Rabbitt as a member
of the Communist Party, and described fraction meetings which
he attended with her.</p>

<p>Jess Fletcher, who was a well-known member of the Communist
Party in Seattle, identified Thomas Rabbitt as a member of the Communist
Party and stated that he had sat in many Communist Party
meetings with him and that he had attended, that Rabbitt had
attended, Communist Party meetings in his home; that is, in Fletcher’s
home.</p>

<p>Nat Honig identified Thomas Rabbitt as a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Harriett Riley identified Thomas Rabbitt as a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>H. C. Armstrong identified Rabbitt as a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Now, you knew at the time of those hearings that Thomas Rabbitt
during those hearings had been identified as a Communist Party
member by numerous individuals; didn’t you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew that at those hearings those people whom
you have named had said that he was a member of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. When I asked you that question, you told us that
you had never heard that Thomas Rabbitt was a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I don’t think I said I ever heard. You asked
if I knew that he was a member of the Communist Party, and I said
no, I didn’t know.</p>

<p>Now, I could go through, and I don’t want to take the time of the
committee, I could tell you like, for instance, Armstrong, Sullivan,
and all of the others, not all of the others, many of those, Kathryn
Fogg, were all members of the State legislature, and they had various
fights and conflicts and so on, and some of them were eliminated from
the legislature, and some weren’t, and so on.</p>

<p>I could go through, Jess Fletcher was in the building-service union
of which Rabbitt also was a member. There was fighting and division
and dissension there.</p>

<p>Now, I think in view of all this, I think it ought to be remembered
I came out in the State of Washington in August of 1944 and many
of these things that have gone on, and so on, I know nothing of, or
knew anything about it.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, one of the principal jobs I had in the Democratic
Party was to try to smooth out a lot of the fighting and dissension
that had gone on between the so-called conservative and progressive
wings of the Democratic Party out there. It was a job that
I was apparently quite successful in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you attend a number of meetings, the purpose
of which was to oppose the holding of the Canwell hearings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I mean the Progressive Party had meetings
and, of course, to oppose the Canwell committee.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_587">587</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you bitterly opposed to the conduct of those
hearings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Decidedly so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was the hearing picketed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. The hearing was picketed; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you in the picket line?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I wasn’t actually in the picket line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you take part in the picketing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was there and I was encouraging the picket line
to be orderly and to make sure that its conduct was correct and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you arrested in connection with a disturbance
calculated to break up those hearings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was arrested for disturbing the peace and disorderly
conduct, but I was acquitted on that charge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. So you were keenly interested in the Canwell
hearings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was decidedly opposed to the Canwell committee.
As a matter of fact, of the 7 members of the committee, I think
we eliminated 6 of them in the following elections.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You knew very well that Tom Rabbitt had been
identified over and over again in the course of those hearings as a
member of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I, of course, was not inside the meetings. I
mean, I didn’t hear a lot of the testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Do you mean to tell us that you didn’t know that
Tom Rabbitt had been identified as a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew, for instance, in the press and the press
reports, and from information given to me that various people in
there had said that Rabbitt and others were members of the Communist
Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Then we cannot rely on your statement of this
morning and yesterday when I asked you whether or not you knew
that Tom Rabbitt, or had heard that Tom Rabbitt was a member
of the Communist Party when you were dealing with him in the
pension union and in the work of the Progressive Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Now, I said, and if my testimony is that I had
not heard, I want to change it, but I said I did not know of my own
knowledge and my testimony is that I did not know of my own
knowledge and even today I do not know of my knowledge that
Rabbitt is a member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>As I understand it, he has not admitted that he is. I think according
to your report he refused to testify and invoked the privilege of
the fifth amendment as far as he was concerned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Didn’t almost the same witnesses identify William
Pennock as a Communist Party member during those same hearings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. So what is true with regard to Mr. Rabbitt, is true
with regard to Mr. Pennock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My testimony is that I didn’t know of my own
knowledge that they were members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You stated you did have a suspicion that they were
members of the Communist Party at the time you were dealing with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_588">588</span>
them in the pension union. Now, will you tell this committee upon
what you based that suspicion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Largely, I was decidedly surprised when I heard
the testimony of many of the people who testified in the Canwell
hearings. I was surprised by Kathryn Fogg who, for instance, was
a Democratic leader in South King County whom I knew real well.
I didn’t dream she was a member of the Communist Party or had been
one. When she came and testified that she had been a member of the
Communist Party and had met in meetings I was certainly surprised.</p>

<p>And H. C. Armstrong&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. When did you first suspect that Rabbitt and Pennock
were members of the Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, the first suspicion that I had was actually
around the period of time of those hearings out there. Up to that
time it had been my job as executive secretary of the Democratic
Party, I had to cover the whole State of Washington. I went around
on tours and trips and speaking schedules and so on, and my contact
with Rabbitt and Pennock largely during the first 2 years I was out
there, 1945 and 1946, really was when I would come in to talk to a
meeting of the King County Democratic Central Committee that they
were sitting on as delegates, Democratic delegates from the 35th Legislative
District.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Yet they were district committee members of the Communist
Party in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. It was fairly well known among politicians at least
that they were; is that not true?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I don’t think so because&mdash;of course, I was completely
dependent upon information from Democratic Party leaders
out there who had been active in the Democratic Party for a long
time. For instance, Rabbitt and Pennock were on various committees
all through the Democratic Party and were actually, of course,
members of the legislature, 1 in the senate and 1 in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were they working with the Progressive Party
after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, but, my position as far as Rabbitt and Pennock&mdash;today
it is easy to go back 5 and 6 years and the developments
that have gone on and the exposures that have been made and so on,
have been much greater in the past than they were then. It was not
my job to determine whether Rabbitt or Pennock was a Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. We acknowledge that, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as the Democratic Party was concerned,
we had certain platforms, certain programs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. But it is difficult for me to believe in your associations,
the various associations you had with them, that you did not know
that they were members of the Communist Party. I want to say that
with all respect to you as a former Member of Congress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I didn’t like Rabbitt; I had very little to do with
Rabbitt. I fired him as a Progressive Party staff man in about May
of 1948.</p>

<p>My first connection with him, where I was close to what he was like
and what he did and so on, all that was from about the latter part
of March 1948 down until May and in May of 1948 I removed him
from the staff of the Progressive Party. I didn’t really like him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_589">589</span></p>

<p>Now, up until Bill Pennock, actually I had talked with Bill Pennock
many times and he was much more, I would say, a real Democrat.
He was in the Democratic Party conclaves; in their meetings and so
on, and, of course, a much more personable fellow and all that, but
until Bill Pennock actually announced, and regardless of this testimony
that is there, and I talked with Bill Pennock after this testimony
was given, and he vociferously denied that he issued statements in the
papers and in the press and everything and pension union statements
were made, up to the minute Bill Pennock made an open statement
just before he was going on trial in the Smith Act cases in 1953 or 1954,
whenever they were out there, I certainly had some real, real doubt
whether Bill Pennock was a member of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>And I think you will find that pretty generally out there, if you
went out and talked to ordinary people out there, who were working
in the Democratic Party, chairmen and State committeemen and so on,
and all of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Well, it is entirely possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. For instance, Governor Wallgren, who had been
in the Congress for 10 years, and had been United States Senator for
about 6 years, Governor Wallgren appointed Pennock to a position as
assistant superintendent of institutions out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. However, that wasn’t after 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, that was in 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. At that time, how would you determine in your own
mind whether or not a person was a member of the Communist Party?
What standards would you use? I am talking about the Wallace campaign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. About which campaign?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. The Progressive campaign with Wallace. What standards
would you use to determine whether or not a man was a Communist?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Taking Rabbitt specifically, the reason I removed
him as a member of the staff in the Progressive Party in 1948, in 1948
the Progressive Party was under attack, particularly nationally, as
being Communist controlled and Communist dominated and being a
Red party and so on, and we had, particularly in South King County,
an organizer by the name of Belden who was a member of various veterans’
groups out there.</p>

<p>Belden was organizing Progressive Party clubs&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. With all due respect, I think you could tell what standards
you would use.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. When Belden was asked by people whether or not
this was a Red party, Belden, of course, would deny it and go on
and say the kind of people who were in it.</p>

<p>Rabbitt was critical of the way that he said that it was not a Red
party and the inference which he left which was in effect a denunciation
of the Reds and all of that and, of course, I figured if he is touchy
about that on the subject and all that, why, there is probably some
basis for it, for the charges that have been made against him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You have not answered the question at all, in my opinion.
Let me ask you this: You were familiar with the fact that the
Soviet Union had established an espionage network here in the United
States by 1948, were you not?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_590">590</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I was not. I don’t know whether that is true
even today. I mean, you asked me and I don’t know. I would have
to be shown and somebody would have to show me where they are and
the proof. I don’t know whether that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Are you familiar with the various Smith Act trials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I have read a lot about the Smith Act trials; yes,
sir. But in none of the Smith Act trials they were not charged with
espionage and treason or anything of that kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. No; of course they were charged with advocating the
overthrow of our form of government by force and violence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It even goes back further than that, conspiring to
teach and all that, but in none of those trials I don’t know any development
of espionage or spying. Of course, I am not familiar with all
the testimony. I have not read it all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Are you familiar with the Rosenberg case?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am familiar with the Rosenberg case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Certainly from the result of that you must have had the
suspicion that there was an espionage network operating in this
country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Even today I am not convinced that the Rosenbergs
were involved in Soviet espionage. Right now I think there
is serious doubt of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Even though they were convicted under our American
system of jurisprudence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Even though they were convicted and executed I
still feel it. You see, Congressman, I have a genuine interest in civil
liberty. It is not a Communist interest in civil liberty. I have
studied the testimony in the case of the Rosenbergs and so on. I think
it is seriously lacking, at least in my mind, and from my very meager
experience as an attorney, it is seriously lacking in fundamental proof
of their guilt. I think Dr. Harold Urey, many scientists and so on,
feel the same way about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, I note when speaking of Pennock
and Rabbitt that a great part of your answers has dealt with the
period when you were secretary for the Democratic Party. But it was
after the Canwell hearings that the Progressive Party was established.
It was in the spring of 1947.</p>

<p>So at the time that Pennock and Rabbitt were associated with the
Progressive Party this information had already come out in the Canwell
hearings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And you have spoken of what happened before the
Canwell hearings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That doesn’t prove to me, I mean knowing many
of the people that testified&mdash;for instance, Jim Sullivan, I know Jim
Sullivan’s attitude and motives. I know precisely that he was president
of the Washington Pension Union and he lost his job and Pennock
got it.</p>

<p>I could go through with those, I could go through each one and
show the particular reason why they testified. I judge by what
Budenz said about me&mdash;Budenz knew I wasn’t a member of the Communist
Party. He didn’t dare testify that I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Will you tell us&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Will you let me finish, Congressman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_591">591</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. You did not answer my question a while ago as to how
you would judge whether or not a person was a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I really haven’t thought about it. I can’t give
you precise standards and tests. I, for instance, don’t think, I mean
the standards and tests set down in the Communist Control Act of
1954 are good; I think they would embrace a lot of people who are non-Communists.
I think it would involve a lot of people who are not
members of the Communist Party if you were to take those tests, for
instance. I think it is entirely too broad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The sum and substance of your testimony is that
the eight witnesses whose testimony I have quoted here are not worthy
of belief and therefore, you just ignored their testimony when the
matter came up of associating Rabbitt and Pennock with you in the
Progressive Party work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Not only as far as I was concerned, but as far as
the people of the State of Washington, particularly in the districts
that these representatives were concerned, and the Legislative Assembly
of the State of Washington itself, this job was so poorly done
by the Canwell committee that the committee was never re-created, and
in the last session of the Legislative Assembly of Washington State
had Canwell before it for contempt for the destruction of the records
of his committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you answer my question, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, the thing I am trying to point out to you is
that I know how those hearings were conducted. There was no opportunity,
no opportunity for cross-examination; no opportunity for witnesses
to come in on the other side, or anything. I mean, people were
paraded there, like Budenz, and the others, came there and made long,
long statements; they just went on and on and made statements about
almost everything imaginable and conceivable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You still haven’t answered my question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As far as I was concerned that did not prove to
me that Rabbitt or Pennock or anybody named in there was Communist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. My question was whether or not you absolutely
ignored the testimony in the selection of those people to assist you in
the work of the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I wouldn’t use the language that I totally
ignored it, or anything, but I was not motivated in my dealings with
them by anything that was developed in those hearings. Now, you
promised me an opportunity to&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have told us that you were acquainted with
Barbara Hartle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, I think that is a correct statement that I was
acquainted with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You stated that you had met her probably 5 times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I met her the first time in Montana. Then I met
her a few times in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I asked Mrs. Hartle in the course of the testimony
taken in June 1954 to tell the committee to what extent the Communist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_592">592</span>
Party in that area was interested in the work of the Progressive Party.
You will find it on page 6215 of her testimony. Her reply was this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To a very considerable extent. After the reconstitution the Communist Party
recognized its revisionism of Marxism-Leninism in the political field, and decided
that the correct program was for a new third anti-imperialist party. After this
ideological campaign had proceeded for at least a year the Progressive Party
was founded preceded for a period by the Progressive Citizens of America. The
Communist Party viewed this as a development along favorable lines and in this
district threw considerable effort into the support and building of it and was
able to furnish the top leadership as well in the State. Hugh DeLacy, head of
the Progressive Citizens of America, Jerry O’Connell, and Tom Rabbitt, head of
the Progressive Party, all three of whom were in executive positions, were members
of the Communist Party to the best of my understanding. I have less
knowledge of O’Connell’s Communist Party membership than of DeLacy and
Rabbitt, but have sat in Communist Party meetings with him when all present
were Communists, and I understood him to be one also, or at least so sympathetic
as to make no actual difference. Many Communist Party members were
for the founding of the Progressive Party in this State and worked in it after
its founding. They numbered in the hundreds. The policy of the Progressive
Party in this State was controlled by the Communist Party and if there were
any problems at all along this line they came from national demands or from
demands of persons and groups working also in the Progressive Party and whom
the Communist Party wanted to retain and influence. Other Communist Party
leaders also in leadership of the Progressive Party were William J. Pennock,
Karley Larsen, Fair Taylor, Tom Rabbitt, Jerry O’Connell.</p></blockquote>

<p>Then she proceeded to refer to other Communist Party members
active in the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>I want to call to your attention the fact that she stated that the
Communist Party furnished the leadership to the Progressive Party
in the State. The first person she named in that capacity was Hugh
DeLacy. What was Hugh DeLacy’s position in the Progressive Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Hugh DeLacy had no position in the Progressive
Party and no office in the Progressive Party, in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was it in the Progressive Citizens of America?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think he was head of the Progressive Citizens of
America. We had actually, when the Progressive Party was organized
we had a real fight because the Progressive Citizens of America
were coming in, they had an organizational drive which was in support
of Wallace as such, but when the Progressive Party of Washington
was actually set up the leadership came not from the people who
were in the Progressive Citizens of America, but from people who
were in the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And people who were in the Young Progressives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I don’t think we had any Young Progressives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you have any position, prior to the formation
of the Progressive Party in any organization other than the Democratic
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. As I told you, we had an organization known
as Roosevelt Democrats; I was executive secretary of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Other than that, you had no position in any group
or branch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, and Tom Rabbitt was not the head of the Progressive
Party. Russell Fluent was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. But he did hold an executive position as stated by
Mrs. Hartle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, he did not.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_593">593</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. What was his position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. As I said, he was on the staff from about, I would
say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Isn’t that an executive position, being a member of
the staff? Was he paid for his services?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He was paid for his services.</p>

<p>I mean, as I understand, he was not in an executive position. He
had an organizational job to do this southern King County. I mean,
he was assigned to organizational work, but it certainly wasn’t, I mean
he wasn’t chairman or vice chairman, or secretary, or any executive
position as I know it. And because of the kind of job he did out
there, I dropped him from the staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Now, DeLacy has been shown to have been a member
of the Communist Party by witnesses other than Barbara Hartle
and since her testimony. Rabbitt has also.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hartle stated she had less knowledge of Communist Party
membership on your part, but that she sat with you in Communist
Party meetings when all present were Communists. Is that statement
true or false?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That statement, as far as I am concerned, is false.
I never sat in any Communist Party meeting with her, at least that
I knew was called a Communist Party meeting. I have never sat in
when all present were Communists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you sit in any Communist Party meeting when
some of the persons present were not Communists?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I do not know what her definition of a Communist
Party meeting would be. That is the first thing that bothers me about
that statement. I, for instance&mdash;I mean if the Communist Party
called a meeting, as I understand her statement here, if the Communist
Party called a meeting I know I never went to that meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you sit in a meeting of Communist Party
members?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. If she means, for instance, that a meeting of probable
Democrats in the 35th District, people who were in the Democrat
Party were there and there was a meeting&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You speak of the Democrat Party each time. This
testimony relates to the Progressive Party. Why not refer to that
period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, she said she sat in Communist Party meetings
with me when all present were Communists. Likewise with the
Progressive Party. I mean there could have been a Progressive Party
meeting called and all that, and all of the people there present might
have been Communists to her knowledge but certainly not to mine.
She is careful; I mean she qualifies, she says, “I understood to be one
or at least so sympathetic as to make no actual difference.” She had
doubts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. At this point that is what this has just about boiled
down to in my mind, Mrs. Hartle’s description. This morning I sat
here and listened to the period of time when you were chairman of the
Committee To Defeat the Mundt Bill. You became associated with
or had business relations with Mr. Silberstein, Mr. Stone, Rose Clinton,
Tom Buchanan, Ruth Rifkin, Elizabeth Sasuly, Tilla Minowitz, Carl
Marzani, Lillian Clott, and Alexander Wright. In each instance you
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_594">594</span>
had an explanation, although we read from the record that others had
said that these people were Communists, that you did not know about
them. Well, that is a little difficult but it could have happened. I am
not reproaching you, but you become a little more indifferent when
you will not accept, for instance, the pronouncement of a court, the
highest court of the land, that Rosenbergs were Communists. You
refuse to accept that; you still are not convinced.</p>

<p>To me her description is becoming pretty good, to be so tolerant as
to be completely indifferent. Probably your mind is shut to having
a standard to satisfy you as to whether a group is or is not Communist.
I am entirely frank about it. Listening all morning my mind at this
time, even more and more as we go along, is that maybe your sincere
feeling&mdash;how did she describe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span> (reading):</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I understand him to be one also, or at least so sympathetic as to make no actual
difference.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Well, if she had used the words “so indifferent,” it
would have been pretty close to my frank analysis of your testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Let me say I concur with your statement, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. If she had substituted the word “indifferent,” it would
have been a close analysis of our appreciation of your testimony up to
now. I look forward, however, to your contest with Mr. Budenz in
that lawsuit that you mentioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I want to assure you that there is a difference.
One can be a sincere American liberal and still fight for the political
rights and civil rights of Communists. I can be non-Communist and
yet not anti-Communist, just like I can be a Democrat and yet not an
anti-Republican.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes, but you still have not given us a standard. It is
hard to put in words&mdash;I do not know how to describe it&mdash;as to what
is my standard, of what is a Communist. I would say that after a
trial by all our courts, including a refusal of relief from the Supreme
Court, refusal of appeals to two Presidents, with all the pressure
brought on them, the courts and executive officers (I suppose they
must have reviewed the record; they all seemed satisfied) but still you
are not satisfied. So that makes it indifferent to me as to what your
standard could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I do not want to go into all of the evidence as I
understand it, but as an attorney I am completely suspicious of the testimony
given by David Greenglass. He had real motives. He had
everything to gain by what he was doing. During the pleas for
clemency and since that time there has been other evidence produced
that in my mind raises a real question, the positions taken by Dr.
Harold Urey and by other scientists as to whether or not the so-called
secret which was transferred or alleged to have been transferred and so
on was a secret at all. These are the things that make me wonder
about it. I am not satisfied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, you of course, noted from the testimony
that I read that Barbara Hartle, who has been qualified as an
expert in this field, stated that the Communist Party furnished the
top leadership in the State of Washington for the Progressive Party.
She also stated that the policy of the Progressive Party in that State
was controlled by the Communist Party.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_595">595</span></p>

<p>Now in that connection I want to follow a little further along with
her testimony to support the extent to which the Communist Party
was in a position to control the Progressive Party. I made this statement
to Mrs. Hartle on page 6216:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Hartle, the committee staff has procured from the secretary of state of
the State of Washington a photostatic copy of the reports required to be made
by law of the proceedings of the nominating convention for the year 1952&mdash;</p></blockquote>

<p>that was the nominating convention of the Progressive Party&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is noted that the certificate is signed by Thomas C. Rabbitt, permanent secretary
of the Progressive Party. You have heretofore identified him as a member
of the Communist Party, have you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hartle</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. The document referred to contains a certificate of attendance at
the nominating convention of the Progressive Party held on the 9th day of September
1952. Will you please examine the list and read into the record the names of
those appearing thereon who are known to you to have been members of the
Communist Party?</p></blockquote>

<p>(The witness then proceeded to read the names of those she had
identified.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Will you now count the number of those whose signatures appear
on the list?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hartle</span>. Yes; 33.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I have kept a record of the number of those identified by you as
members of the Communist Party. Out of the total list of 33 names, you have
identified 19.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Hartle further testified that while she was in the underground
of the Communist Party, which meant after 1950&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It is on the same page.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I received a brief description of what this Independent Party was. I was
told that it had been impossible to place candidates for the Communist Party
on the election ballot and that steps were taken then to put Communist candidates
on an Independent Party ticket and take this means of bringing the
Communist program into the election campaign.</p></blockquote>

<p>The result was that we furnished to Mrs. Hartle a list of 49 persons
certified by an affidavit to have attended the nominating convention
of the Independent Party. Mrs. Hartle was asked to examine that
list. Of the 49 persons appearing on the list, she identified 36 as
known to her to be members of the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That list, of course, is all 1952 with reference to
the Progressive Party in 1950, with reference to the so-called Independent
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. My testimony is that I left the State of Washington
in October 1949.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I could distinguish if we had the time, as far as
these people were concerned, with reference to the Progressive Party
as it existed when I was there.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, a short recess was taken.)</p>

<p>(The committee members present when the hearing reconvened
were Messrs. Willis and Velde.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The subcommittee will come to order.</p>

<p>Proceed, Mr. Tavenner.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_596">596</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. O’Connell, you told us a few minutes ago that
Hugh DeLacy had not been connected with your organization; that
is, the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I did not say that he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You said he was not in an executive position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He was not in an executive position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was he an organizer employed by you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I do not remember whether he was there during
the period when the party was actually organized, but he was there
for a period of a few weeks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That was in 1948, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In 1948 when the organization work was being
done. Then he later went on to the position with the national office of
the Progressive Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. He finally became the head of the Progressive
Party for the State of Ohio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. According to his testimony, he was employed as a
State organizer for the Progressive Party in Washington from sometime
around February or March, perhaps even later, of 1948, up to
somewhere around June of the same year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think that is comparatively correct. My remembrance
of it is that the provisional committee operated from
about March, I would say around March 23 of 1948, and we actually
had the founding convention of the rest of the party in the State of
Washington the latter part of May.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. DeLacy was a paid functionary for the Progressive
Party during the period he indicated, was he not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. He was a paid organizer during that period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did you employ him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I could not say strictly that I employed him. I
think that there was an executive committee group that was set up
at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you his superior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was his superior; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Now you indicated that you desired an opportunity
to explain the testimony that Mr. Louis Budenz&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Before you come to that, you started to say 3 or 4
times that you had fired Mr. Rabbitt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I fired Mr. Rabbitt; I removed him from the staff.
Is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes. Why did you fire him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I explained he was organizing in southern King
County and he was supercritical of the work of a man by the name
of Belden who was organizing clubs in what we call the 30th Legislative
District of King County. The party was being attacked as being
Communist or Communist-controlled or Red, and Belden was trying
to explain as an ordinary individual that it was not Communist-controlled
and was not Red. In the course of his explanation, at least,
left anti-Communist inference; Rabbitt was critical of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. It appears from the certificate made under law to
the State of Washington that he was secretary of the Progressive
Party in 1952&mdash;that Rabbitt was secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In 1952?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_597">597</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I, of course, of my own knowledge would not know
if that is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Did he remain on the executive committee of the
Progressive Party after the time you say you discharged him from
his paid position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, not as long as I was there. When I left in
October of 1949, as I understand, in the early part of December a
resolution was passed by the State board of the Progressive Party
declaring my office vacant because I had not returned from the State
of Montana. Either at that meeting or shortly after, Rabbitt was
named by the executive committee. I think, first, the original title
given to him was coordinator. Later I think he was made executive
secretary. I know these things from what people have told me, but
not of my own knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I am not sure that you have answered specifically
my question relating to the testimony of Barbara Hartle insofar as
it referred to you. Barbara Hartle testified that you attended Communist
Party meetings in which she was present where all the persons
present were members of the Communist Party. Did you attend any
such meeting or meetings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span> I think my explanation of that was that if I sat
in a Communist Party meeting or what she considered to be a Communist
Party meeting where all present were Communists, I had no
knowledge that they were Communists or it was a Communist Party
meeting. Since I read the testimony yesterday, I tried to recall all
the meetings out there where there would be a possibility she was
present. I just cannot recall the occasions I saw Barbara Hartle out
there&mdash;usually on the street or something of that kind&mdash;and I cannot
recall any meeting that she sat in that I was in. I just cannot remember
any single meeting that she sat in there where at least I knew
she was there. She might have been in another room or some other
place, but she was not visible to me anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you a member of the Communist Party during
the period of time you were in the State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you at any time while in the State of Washington,
that is, between 1944 and 1949, affiliated in any way with the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I was not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you at any time a member of the Communist
Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I am not now and I have never been a member of
the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You stated a desire to explain the testimony of Mr.
Louis Budenz given at the Canwell hearings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. At the Canwell hearings, Mr. Budenz&mdash;I
think to save time, and I want to save time, Mr. Budenz testified that&mdash;I
think the substance of his testimony was that he did not know
whether or not I was a Communist, very much like Mrs. Hartle does.
I think it is significant that she was the second top Communist in the
State of Washington; and yet if I were the leading Communist that
she says I was out there, she still is not sure whether I was or not.
I think that is quite significant.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_598">598</span></p>

<p>Likewise with Budenz. He was not sure whether I was Communist,
but he had heard some discussion about me in the Communist
Party headquarters in New York. As far as he knew, in meetings
that he had heard, I was supposed to be all right and I was a person
they could get along with. He made many statements of that kind.
Then he went into the statement about the assassination of Leon
Trotsky, which to the press in the State of Washington, left the
impression that particularly somehow or other I was involved. So I
sued Mr. Budenz in a civil suit in the Superior Court of King County
the very next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. In New York?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; in the State of Washington&mdash;Seattle, Wash.
I sued him for libel for the statements that he made about me. I
fixed the sum of damages at $1,500,000. He was served with subpena,
legally served with a summons, rather, in that suit, and through his
attorneys defended the suit by taking advantage of his immunity as a
legislative witness before the State legislative committee. He did
not defend it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. What do you mean, he did not defend it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I mean instead of letting the thing come to trial,
instead of letting the issue come to trial on facts, to be tried on the
facts, and so on, he and his attorneys hid behind his legislative immunity
that he was in the State of Washington by virtue of a subpena
to appear before the legislative committee of the State of Washington
and under the laws of the State could not be legally served with a
summons and sued in the State. The case was dismissed on that
ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Was this the testimony to which you referred:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I will ask you, Professor, Do you know a former Congressman from Montana
by the name of Jerry O’Connell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Budenz</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Question. Do you know whether or not Mr. O’Connell was a member of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Budenz</span>. Not that specific. I know that he was one whom the party felt
it must take care of because of his agreement constantly with the party line.
This came up in the case of Congressman John T. Bernard, of Minnesota, and
Congressman O’Connell. The discussion came up in the national headquarters
of the Communist Party in the committee headed by William Winant about how
to take care of these Congressmen because they agreed with the party line.
And it was agreed that Bernard and O’Connell both would get jobs with the
International Workers Order, this Communist-controlled front to which I have
referred.</p>

<p>Now, it is my impression that&mdash;well, I know that Bernard got it, and it is my
impression that Mr. O’Connell temporarily also received that cynosure through
the cooperation of the party. I heard the discussion in the party circles first,
and later on I heard that it was to be accomplished.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is the testimony to which you refer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is the testimony to which I refer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were employed by the International Workers
Order, were you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In order not to prolong it&mdash;Congressman Willis
did not hear this, but yesterday I testified about my connections with
the International Workers Order. The original contact, as I remember,
was made by Peter Shipka to advise the local Serbs and
Croats which existed in the city of Butte. It was, as I remember,
during a period when I think Hitler had already invaded Yugoslavia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_599">599</span>
and it was a question of whether they were supporting Milhailovich
or Pavlich. There was a lot of dissension going on between the Serbs
and Croats. I was asked to go down and advise with them and help
with them. Many of them I knew because of my political candidacies
for legislature and for the railroad and public service commission
and for Congress there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. That is all in the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes. Then I was sent on a specific job to do with
reference to these coal miners at Steamboat Springs who were applying
for citizenship and were members of the International Workers
Order.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You were employed to go on speaking tours over
the country for which you were paid $200 a month and your expenses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I made only one speaking tour on the plan for
plenty. The plan for plenty we had was an improved social security,
called for improvement of the social security system as it existed at
that time. I made some speeches. You asked me what I got, how
much compensation I had received. I said in my opinion it would
average about $200 a month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. And your expenses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. And my expenses, yes. I knew nothing about Mr.
Budenz’ discussion with the Communist Party headquarters or anything.
I got a call from Mr. Shipka. I am sure it was Mr. Shipka,
the treasurer of the organization, who asked me first to do these two
specific jobs which I did within a short time. Then later he called
me to make these speeches on a plan for plenty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Now I have before me an excerpt from the May 29,
1941, issue of Montana Labor News. The title is, “IWO Names
O’Connell Rocky Mountain Director.” It is datelined New York,
May 10. I will read it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Former Representative Jerry J. O’Connell, labor’s fighting Congressman from
Montana, has been appointed regional director for the International Workers
Order in the Rocky Mountain area, Herbert Benjamin, executive secretary of
that organization, announced today. “Mr. O’Connell will be able to continue
his effort on behalf of the labor movement on a much broader scale in his new
post,” Herbert Benjamin declared, “since the IWO is labor’s foremost and largest
fraternal benefit society. Our national membership of 155,000 supports the
trade-union movement and its individual members on many fronts; providing
insurance, sickness, and accident benefits at low rates, a rounded program of
club and fraternal social life, plus a nationwide campaign for improving living
standards, and social security embodied in our plan for plenty.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. That is the first I knew&mdash;nobody told me that I
was to be regional director of the IWO. As far as I can remember,
as far as their clubs were concerned out in the Rocky Mountain area,
they had one in Butte, which was the only one they had in the whole
State of Montana. I think they had one down in this town called
Steamboat Springs, Col. Those were the only two clubs that I know
of in the Rocky Mountain area. There were certainly no&mdash;at least on
my part, there was no idea I was to be regional director, because the
first 2 assignments that I got were first to go down to advise this club in
Butte and the other to go down to this Steamboat Springs, in Colorado,
and clear up the question that the judge and the examiner were raising
there. The judge at the time thought that the IWO and the IWW
were one and the same. I brought Mr. Charles Cunningham, I think
his name was, commissioner of insurance of the State of Colorado, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_600">600</span>
the judge to point out that the IWO was a fraternal benefit organization.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. You have explained all that in exactly the same
detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes, but the concept that I was a regional
director&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I am not so sure I followed you on the reason for the
dismissal of the suit you filed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I did not dismiss the suit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I do not think I caught the point. Was it a jurisdictional
question? Specifically, what was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. It was a motion to quash. Actually, it arose on
the motion to quash the service of the summons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. On what grounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. On the grounds that Mr. Budenz had immunity
as a legislative witness before the State legislative committee that he
was appearing before in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. He was not from Washington&mdash;not a resident of the
State of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; he was a resident of New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. You filed suit against him in Washington at a time
while he happened to be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. While he happened to be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. But he was there on State legislative business?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. And therefore was immune from service, and that was
the basis for his motion to quash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. We served the summons on him. My desire was to
get a test and a trial on the factual merits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Was it filed in the State or Federal court?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In the superior court of King County.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. His motion to quash was based on the fact he was served
with the papers while he happened to be in the State of Washington
on State legislative business and therefore was not subject to service
process?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. And his motion came up before the court and the court
dismissed the action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Did you sue him elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. And I did not pursue it elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. You did not file suit elsewhere against him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. By the time that was done he was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I am not talking about that. You could have sued
him. Anybody is subject to suit somewhere, and his domicile is the
real place. I say did you not pursue him, upon dismissal of the suit
in Washington and file another suit elsewhere?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. You mean go to New York and file a suit against
him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; certainly not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Or in the Federal court or in any court?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I would have to go to New York. If he
was a resident of New York, I would have to go to New York in order
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_601">601</span>
to get service; but I had him out in the State of Washington where
I did get service on him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I desire to offer the photostatic copy of the news
article from the Montana Labor News and ask that it be marked as
“O’Connell Exhibit No. 7” for identification purposes only, and to
be made a part of the committee files.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. It is so ordered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I would like the record to show at this point that
the International Workers Order was cited as subversive and Communist
by Attorney General Tom Clark on December 4, 1947, and
again on September 21, 1948, and that it was cited by Attorney General
Francis Biddle on September 24, 1942, as one of the strongest
Communist organizations. It has also been cited by other committees,
including this committee.</p>

<p>Were you acquainted with its secretary, Herbert Benjamin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I knew Herbert Benjamin. I am pretty sure he
is the same Herbert Benjamin who was an officer in the Workers
Alliance during WPA days, when I was in Congress. But I have
actually had no contact with Benjamin in the IWO. In fact, this
is the first I knew he had any connection with the IWO. But I knew
him; I am sure he was lobbying here on the Hill with a man by the
name of David Lasser while I was in Congress. I think he was with
the Workers Alliance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you acquainted with Louis Budenz prior to
the time he appeared as a witness at the Canwell hearings in the State
of Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I was not acquainted with him. Shortly
before he left the Communist Party he wrote me a letter asking me to
write a series of articles for the Daily Worker about Senator Wheeler,
which I refused, which I rejected. That is the only contact I ever
had. I never met Budenz, never saw him or anything, until he was
out in the State of Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Did he want you to write articles favorable to Senator
Wheeler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, he wanted me to write anti-Wheeler articles.
Senator Wheeler and I became tangled politically out there. I was
going to run against Senator Wheeler for the Senate in 1940, and
Senator Wheeler of course took care of me in 1938. So I did not get
to run. I mean the fight, there were people who were anxious to defeat
Wheeler from 1940 on down until he was actually defeated in 1946.</p>

<p>He wrote that letter to me, I would say, just shortly before he left
the Communist Party.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Those articles were to appear in the Daily Worker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. In the Daily Worker; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Would an unfavorable article appearing in the Daily
Worker be harmful to one’s political life in those days in Montana?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, I mean&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. You did not want to inject yourself in it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I did not want to write the articles, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. I would say the best compliment to me in my district
would be for the Daily Worker to say that I was a rotter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, I think that would be true today. You
would be surprised if you went out to the State of Montana and went
into some of the mining camps and taverns and what not. For instance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_602">602</span>
we have a character in Butte by the name of Paddy King. Paddy sells
the Daily Worker. He has silicosis. He is a real character around
there. He goes all around the town. Everybody buys the Daily
Worker from Paddy. They do not think much of it. Some of them
read it, some of them throw it away, and so on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you still read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No; I do not. Of course, I do not live in Butte
any longer. I actually do not think I have seen the Daily Worker
since they used to be delivered to our doors here in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Were you acquainted with Alexander Bittelman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No. Who is he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Alexander Bittelman has been identified in testimony
as a functionary of the Communist Party in the city of New
York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I do not know any Alexander Bittelman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. Mr. Chairman, I have no further questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. I have no questions to ask the witness. It is apparent
from his testimony, that Mr. O’Connell has a great deal of knowledge
about Communist Party activities which he has refused to give this
committee. That does not disturb me as much as the fact that it
appears that he is still ideologically favorable to the Communist Party
of the United States. It is very regrettable, but apparently every
person, including those favorable to the Communist Party, has a right
to express his opinion in this country. I want to say this: I hope
that Mr. O’Connell will think this matter over in the future and give
us the benefit of the knowledge that he possesses about the activities
of the Communist Party in the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Congressman, I have done my very best. I have
talked to you. I do not want to argue. I do say that I appreciate
all the consideration which the committee has given me, particularly
on the two instances when I asked for continuations because of my
illness. I appreciate the fairness with which the committee has
treated me throughout the hearings. I just want to say that, as far
as I am concerned&mdash;that is, the best way I can describe it honestly
and sincerely, is that from my environment, from the poverty since
my birth and the things that happened to me as a child and as a
young man, and so on, I grew up in a very, very liberal tradition
where people were certainly tolerant of all the various shades and
hues of political opinion as we saw them. I think I could best describe
myself, I am just an old-fashioned American liberal. I want to assure
you that I have had no training&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I do not want to prolong the discussion. At the
beginning of the hearing you mentioned the fact that you had passed
the bar in Montana, and that you are now a practicing lawyer, and
you intended to forget about any type of political activity. I just
wonder whether you consider the Communist Party activity as being
political.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. I think you asked me that question before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tavenner</span>. I do not think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Well, somebody asked me it before. As far as I
am concerned, I am not engaged in any Communist Party activity
in the State of Montana or any party activity, Progressive, or Democrat,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_603">603</span>
or anything. I have been asked by the Progressive Party in
1950 to run for the United States Senate and I refused. I have been
asked by the press in Montana&mdash;I am not being braggadocio or conceited&mdash;by
the various newspapers, the Great Falls Tribune, the
Lewistown Daily News, and many others, whether I was going to come
back into the political life of the State. I have always told them,
and told them constantly, that I wanted to be a lawyer; I wanted to
be, if I could, the best lawyer that Montana ever had. That was the
desire that I had. I have been practicing law to the very best of my
ability. When a man starts to practice law, as I did, when he is about
40 years of age, he has a lot to learn. There are many&mdash;well, I am
sure, Mr. Willis, as an attorney you know the best teacher, of course,
is experience. I have been trying to keep my nose clean and hewing
to the line. I have been practicing law. That is what I have been
doing. I think in my work out there I have earned the respect and
consideration of all the people in the kind of job I have been doing.</p>

<p>We do not have any integrated bar in the State of Montana. The
Montana Supreme Court regulates and supervises the bar out there.
I am sure that the members of the supreme court will tell you the
things I have said here today about my friend and all that are true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. Do you not think you are a bit gullible or naive when
you say that you did not know there was a Soviet espionage ring
operating in this country? Tell the committee the truth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Now listen. I think I have set forth my position.
I do not know that that is actually true. I do not know that it is
true. I do not know it. I have never met a Soviet spy that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. It is just unbelievable to me. Of course, that is just
my opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. You are in a different position than I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Velde</span>. With all your connections that have been brought out
here with the various front groups, with all of your connections with
well-known Communists, not to realize that there has been an espionage
ring operating in this country is amazing to me. You are an
intelligent man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Any of those groups or any of the individuals that
have been mentioned here can be tied down to specific programs or
purposes or things of that kind, but certainly nothing along the line
of espionage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. Would it surprise you if they were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. No, it would not surprise me; but what I am saying
is that I do not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Willis</span>. The committee is adjourned and the witness is dismissed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">O’Connell</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>(Whereupon, at 5:25 p. m., the hearing in the above matter was
concluded and the committee recessed to the call of the Chair.)

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
